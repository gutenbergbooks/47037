<h1 title="">The Boy Scouts
<br />At the Battle of Saratoga</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP IN THE WOODS.</span></h2>
<p>The sunset had brought to a close the hottest day
of the season (June, 1777). With the fading of
the light a cool breeze came in from Lake Champlain,
sweeping across the big promontory, near the foot of
which a single tent was pitched. As the wind rustled
in the tree tops above the canvas shelter, its occupants
arose from the rude beds of fir boughs, and
sought the outer air. This act revealed their number
and character&mdash;three lads, not far from eighteen years
of age, whose rugged faces, brawny muscles and rude
clothing suggested, as was the fact, that they had
been bred to a frontier life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Dan,&rdquo; the tallest of the group remarked
as he yawned and stretched himself to his full height,
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t it &rsquo;bout time that feller we are waitin&rsquo; for
hove in sight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got an hour longer, Late,&rdquo; the boy answered,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; may show up in that time. General Schuyler,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
when he tole me to find you an&rsquo; Joe an&rsquo; come up
here, said: &lsquo;Pitch your tent on that big point to the
left of the Narrows, an&rsquo; wait three days for the feller
I&rsquo;ve sent to watch Burgoyne&rsquo;s fleet that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;
down to attack Fort Ticonderoga. He&rsquo;ll jine ye by
that time, an&rsquo; tell ye what to do.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s plain
&rsquo;nough even for your thick head to understand, an&rsquo;
as we ain&rsquo;t been here three days till it&rsquo;s pitch dark,
I say thar&rsquo;s an hour for him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer the general didn&rsquo;t tell you who it was,&rdquo;
commented the third lad, who had been spoken of
as &ldquo;Joe.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that six or seven times already,&rdquo;
Dan retorted somewhat sharply, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve told ye as
often that it wasn&rsquo;t my style. I always leave it for
the general to tell me what he thinks I orter know,
an&rsquo; leave unsaid what he&rsquo;d rather keep to himself.
Whosomever this feller is, he&rsquo;ll be likely to explain,
an&rsquo; I can wait without worryin&rsquo; over it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause your habit for askin&rsquo; questions
wasn&rsquo;t ever fully developed,&rdquo; Late broke in with a
chuckle. &ldquo;But we shan&rsquo;t have to wait long &rsquo;fore
we at least see the feller, for, if I&rsquo;m not mistook,
thar he comes now down the lake,&rdquo; and he pointed
to a dark object which was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a canoe, an&rsquo; a youngster like ourselves,&rdquo;
Dan added a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you make that out,&rdquo; Late cried.
&ldquo;I can only see that it&rsquo;s a boat of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause your eyesight was never fully developed,&rdquo;
Dan retorted with a grin. &ldquo;I can see him
well enough. But since he&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; we better get to
hustlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; have supper ready. If he&rsquo;s traveled far
he&rsquo;ll be hungry, an&rsquo; we may make a good impression
by showin&rsquo; we are liberal providers. I&rsquo;ll start the
fire, an&rsquo; Joe can get the water, while you, Late, bring
up those fish we caught this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next half hour the campers were too busy
with their preparations to give more than an occasional
glance up the lake at the approaching boat.
But what they saw confirmed Dan&rsquo;s words. The
newcomer was a lad of about their own age, and was
able to handle a canoe with the grace and skill of an
Indian.</p>
<p>At length, however, the potatoes were baked, the
fish broiled, and the corn-cakes done to a turn. Then
Late spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s nearly here. Let&rsquo;s go
down to the shore to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrades followed him without a word. Clambering
down the steep bank to the water&rsquo;s edge, they
waited in silence the arrival of the voyager. He
could see them standing there, and, though several
rods away, paused in his paddling long enough to
raise one hand and wave it above his head. They
returned the salutation; but refrained from the cheer
all longed to give. They were not sure of being alone
in the forest, and, with that caution which comes to
all accustomed to a frontier life, made no noise that
might attract the attention of an enemy.</p>
<p>Two minutes later the canoe touched the beach,
and its occupant leaped out. For an instant he stood
there, running a keen eye over the three lads whom
he knew would be his associates in the hazardous
work of reporting the movements of a hostile army.
They, in their turn, gazed critically at the one who
was for a time to be their leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>He saw three youths, rough, uncultured, and yet
as stout of heart as the great trees among which they
had lived, as keen as the steel of the knives that graced
their belts. They, on their part, beheld a lad a trifle
older than themselves, taller by an inch than Late,
and as stalwart in frame as he, yet a lad whose studious
face suggested the school; whose air of refinement
seemed more in keeping with the town than the
woods; and whose every movement told of one accustomed
to command.</p>
<p>The brightening of his and their faces told that
he and they had alike been pleased with what they
saw; then, before the stranger could speak, the waiting
lads picked up the canoe, and started toward the
camp with it. The newcomer added his own strength
to the burden, and almost noiselessly they ascended
the promontory, dropping the boat aside the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here at last,&rdquo; the unknown lad now said in
a low and pleasant voice. &ldquo;Have you waited long
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days, lackin&rsquo; a few minutes,&rdquo; Dan replied,
acting as spokesman for the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were here at the earliest moment suggested
by the general,&rdquo; the first speaker said heartily.
&ldquo;I like that. It shows that he has given me assistants
who can be relied upon for promptness. The
silence in which you met me proves that you can be
discreet. The supper you have ready bespeaks your
hospitality. They are all traits I appreciate&mdash;especially
the last, after my pull of thirty miles. Let
us eat and get acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree near the fire,
which now was no more than a bed of coals, he began
to eat with that relish which long exercise in the open
air always imparts.</p>
<p>At once the entire party was engaged in the same
agreeable task. As they ate their conversation was,
during a time, of little importance; but when the
keen hunger of the leader had been somewhat appeased,
he paused long enough between mouthfuls to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your names, comrades; but which is which
I do not yet know. I wonder if I can pick you out,&rdquo;
and again he ran his keen eye quickly from one to
the other. Late laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My knife &rsquo;gainst yours that you can&rsquo;t tell who I
am on the first guess,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would hardly be a fair wager,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;for my knife is worth more than yours. But I&rsquo;ll
venture a guess without a bet. You are Latham
Wentworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me somewhere &rsquo;fore now,&rdquo; the crestfallen
youth cried when the laughter of his companions
had subsided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you gave yourself away when you made
the bet. I have been told that you are always ready to
wager anything you possess, from the shoes on your
feet to the cap on your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he admitted, joining in the
laugh at his expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it the good book says &rsquo;bout &lsquo;their works
do follow them&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Dan at this point. &ldquo;I
guess that is true of the livin&rsquo; as well as the dead,
Late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remark that proves you are Daniel Cushing,&rdquo;
was the comment of the newcomer. &ldquo;You see I
am nearly as well acquainted with you, as with Wentworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the general, or somebody, had sized
us up &rsquo;bout right to you,&rdquo; young Cushing said
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chance for me to hide it, so I&rsquo;ll admit
I&rsquo;m Joseph Fisher, at your service,&rdquo; that young man
cried laughingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quick to say it, too, for fear
you&rsquo;ll show up some of my failin&rsquo;s. But you haven&rsquo;t
told us your own name, an&rsquo; the general didn&rsquo;t, either.
I think we orter know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had put your last sentences first, your
confession of your identity would hardly have been
necessary,&rdquo; was the significant answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your demand is a fair one,&rdquo; the lad replied,
&ldquo;and though it was my first thought to withhold my
real name, you shall know it, but you must never
call me by it, nor use it between yourselves when I
am absent. It is not, in fact, to be spoken aloud.
You will understand later why I make this strange
request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he drew from the bosom of his
hunting-shirt an iron cross, which evidently was attached
to a chain about his neck. Taking hold of the
top above the horizontal bar, he gave it a vigorous
twist. It came off, showing that the lower portion
was hollow, and contained a tiny paper. This he
took out, and passed to Daniel Cushing, who sat nearest
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read, and then pass it on,&rdquo; he directed.</p>
<p>The parchment was so small, that only a few words
could have been written on it. These Dan slowly
spelled out, and then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir. It shall be as you say, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll find that Dan Cushing never yet broke his
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the paper to Late, who, after a little
effort, mastered its contents, and then cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of such a thing, sir. You are
right. &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do to whisper the name even to each
other, lest the woods hear us. But &rsquo;twill be a pleasure
to serve under you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe now had his opportunity to peruse the writing,
and, being a better reader than his companions,
quickly gathered the meaning of the brief lines.
Running over to the leader, he seized his hand and
shook it vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deem it an honor to serve under you,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll find I can keep a secret, if I am
always eager to solve one. But what are we to call
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present I am to be known to you, as I
shall be to the British, as Ira Le Geyt,&rdquo; was the smiling
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The renegade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three exclamations escaped the lips of the
hearers in sheer amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tory, spy, and renegade,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
&ldquo;Do you fear that I can&rsquo;t play the part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, sir,&rdquo; Dan answered hastily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
danger you run. &rsquo;Spose some one happens into the
camp who knows the real Ira, or what if he happened
to show up? You&rsquo;d be in a tight place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Schuyler has the real Ira where he
can&rsquo;t make any trouble,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and I have
the young Tory&rsquo;s entire outfit in yonder canoe&mdash;rifle,
clothes, commission as a scout in Burgoyne&rsquo;s army,
and, as you have seen, his iron cross, the token by
which he was to come and go among the Indians.
Some say that in form and feature we are not unlike.
I hope, therefore, to pass myself off for him. Of
course there is a risk, but I am willing to take that
for the sake of the Cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last declaration was made modestly, almost
reverently, and a few moments of silence followed.
Then the lad went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This reveals my plan, and shows why I need you.
As a trusted scout at the British headquarters, I
hope to learn enough about the commander&rsquo;s movements
to keep our officers between here and Fort
Stanwix fully posted. But some other must carry
the news. That is to be your work. At regular appointed
places just outside the British lines, one or
more of you will always be in waiting. To you I will
come with everything our men should know. I hope,
too, we may be able to delay, if not thwart altogether,
many of the red-coats&rsquo; plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they soon be here?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some time to-morrow,&rdquo; Ira (as we shall now
call him) replied. &ldquo;I have kept just ahead of the
fleet since it started down the St. Lawrence. At noon
it was becalmed thirty miles up the lake. But a
breeze sprang up, as you know, at sundown, and it
must be under way again. The British will come
slowly; but by daylight we ought to see the first
vessels from this headland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you know how many there are?&rdquo;
questioned Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vessels? yes,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;There are
sixty-one in all, frigates, schooners, sloops, and transports.
But the number of the troops I have not yet
got at clearly enough to make a report. That will be
our task as they land. We&rsquo;ll stay here to-night, and
early in the morning move camp to the place I have
chosen as our rendezvous while the enemy is in this
locality. Then we will return here, or to some other
place where we can watch the landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time longer they discussed the exciting
situation, and then sought their rude beds within the
tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Nothing disturbed their slumbers during the night
hours; but with the first light of the morning all were
astir. Ira had been the first to awake, and, rising,
he hurried away to the edge of the promontory and
looked up the lake. The next instant he wheeled
about, and went back to the camp rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried in a low tone. &ldquo;The fleet is
not over five miles away, and we must be on the
move. It won&rsquo;t do to stop here even long enough to
get breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions needed no other warning. Springing
up they aided in emptying the canoe of its contents,
after which the light craft was carried some
distance into the forest, and hidden in a dense thicket.
Returning to the camp they speedily took down the
tent, packed it and all their belongings into four
bundles, and, shouldering these, hastened off toward
the west under the guidance of their chief.</p>
<p>With the directness of one who knew where he was
going, he led them to a narrow ravine a mile away.
Entering this, he descended to a small brook, which
with a noisy murmur ran through it. Along the bank
he traveled until the ground was so wet and soft that
walking became difficult. It was clear they were now
on the edge of a great swamp. Beneath a huge maple
he paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mark this tree,&rdquo; he said in a low voice to his
followers, &ldquo;and for two reasons: We must here enter
the stream in order to reach the place where we shall
make our camp. See, between those two limbs is
a small cavity. Every day after I enter the British
lines one of you must come here and look into the
hole. When it is impossible for me to visit you at the
rendezvous, I shall put my messages in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking he had pulled off his boots. His
companions removed theirs, and in single file they
began the descent of the brook. Denser and denser
grew the underbrush, until with great difficulty they
forced their way between the branches which overhung
the tiny stream. For a quarter of a mile they
struggled through the tangle, and then it abruptly
ended at the edge of a small pond, near the middle
of which was a tiny island. Here Ira spoke
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that big hemlock on the island nearly
opposite us?&rdquo; and as the lads nodded assent, he went
on, &ldquo;Keep a straight line for that, and you&rsquo;ll find
the water shallow enough for wading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued the journey, and a minute later all
had gained the island, where they found the ground
firm and dry, while the trees were large and far
enough apart to let in the bright sunshine. A carpet
of thick grass added to the beauty of the spot, while
a sparkling spring gurgled at the foot of a great bowlder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, dropping the pack
from his shoulders. &ldquo;How did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would think of looking for us here,&rdquo;
Late said contentedly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that trail down the brook
hides every trace of our steps. A dog couldn&rsquo;t follow
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood an&rsquo; water right at hand, an&rsquo; fish in the
pond,&rdquo; added Dan with a quick glance around him.
&ldquo;Sure ye didn&rsquo;t make it to order, Ira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad leader laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy some people would say I found it by
chance. I prefer, however, to believe that I was led
to it, and to a dozen other places between here and
the Hudson fully as good, by the same kind Providence
that is watching over our Cause, and will
eventually give us the victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t hurt us to think so,&rdquo; young Cushing replied
cheerily.</p>
<p>Then the little party fell to making camp. In a
short time the tent was pitched, beds of fir made, and
breakfast cooked. Quickly breaking their fast, they
began the return to the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>In a half hour they reached it, to find the advance
vessels of the British fleet at anchor in the large bay
just above the promontory where they had first
camped. Two boats, loaded with soldiers, soon came
ashore.</p>
<p>From their hiding-place the lads watched these
men, only to learn that their object was to select and
arrange a camping ground. Hardly was their task
finished when the work of landing the men was begun.</p>
<p>Soon it was proceeding so rapidly, and at so many
different places, that the young scouts were obliged
to divide forces in order to count the troops. Four
stations were, therefore, selected, covering the entire
bay, and from these the lads kept account of the constantly
increasing numbers.</p>
<p>It was not until late on the afternoon of the second
day that they were able to come together again to
compare notes. Then a little mental reckoning enabled
Ira to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are now ready for my first report. I shall
never send written messages to our officers unless I
am forced to do so. There will then be nothing to
fall into the enemy&rsquo;s hands should you be captured.
Late, you are to go to Fort Ticonderoga, and say to
General St. Clair<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> that General Burgoyne has landed
and is now encamped near the great promontory at
the foot of the lake. He has with him eight thousand
British and Hessian troops, four hundred Indians,
and forty cannon. Should he give you any message
for me, put it in the big maple. Dan, go to Fort
Edward and deliver precisely the same message to
General Schuyler. Both of you are to return to our
island camp as soon as possible. Joe will be there
when you arrive. I shall stay there to-night, and
early in the morning will enter the British camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE MISSING MESSAGES.</span></h2>
<p>The sun had been up a full half hour the next
morning when Joe awoke. Raising his head he looked
about him. He was alone. Springing to his feet he
hastened to the door. The camp-fire had been built;
the breakfast was slowly cooking; but Ira was nowhere
to be seen.</p>
<p>A low splash, as though some one was wading across
the pond, reached his ears. The tent faced south,
while the approach to the island by the way of the
brook was from the east. He was obliged, therefore,
to step outside his shelter in order to obtain a view of
the direction from which the sound came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The moment he did so he found it difficult to suppress
the cry of alarm that rose to his lips, for there,
not more than two rods away, was a stranger, who,
having just put on his huge boots after wading over
to the island, looked up in time to catch sight of him.
Instantly bringing his rifle to his shoulder the intruder
called out in loud, gruff tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are, youngster. Any attempt on
your part to get a gun will force me to fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing his words had the required effect, he came
a little nearer, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your companion ran away when I came up. Is it
he, or you, who has my iron cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Joe could do no more than stare at
the speaker. Could it be that the real Ira Le Geyt
had escaped from the hands of General Schuyler, and
in some way traced out the lad who was intending to
personate him in the British camp?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be ye?&rdquo; he finally questioned, using the
time he gained thereby to examine the newcomer
carefully.</p>
<p>He certainly resembled the other Ira. This fellow
did not appear to be quite so tall; he was more
stout; his hair was a shade or two darker; his nose
was more prominent; and he looked older.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>There was a greater difference in his dress. He
wore high top-boots, an English hunting suit of
costly material, a belt of polished leather, containing
a brace of pistols and a silver-handled knife, while on
his back was a huge knapsack, apparently filled to
overflowing.</p>
<p>Scarcely had Joe learned all this, when the answer
to his query came in an angry voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I? You ought to know. Again I ask,
have you my iron cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This settled matters with the listener. Here was
the real Ira, and the thing to do was to outwit and
capture him, call back his friend, and then their plans
might go on as arranged. With this object in view
he edged slowly along towards the intruder, saying
innocently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you before, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; belongin&rsquo;
to you, sir, but&mdash;&rdquo; and with a tremendous bound he
caught his antagonist&rsquo;s gun, tearing it from his grasp.
Flinging it away, he seized the owner by the body,
pinning his arms to his sides, and then finished his
sentence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise there was no struggle. Instead, a
voice he knew well cried out laughingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Joe; but you must admit I as neatly
fooled you. I guess I shall be able to play my part
at the British quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it, I swaney,&rdquo; Joe said a little sheepishly.
Releasing his prisoner, he stepped away a
few feet and looked him over again, this time more
critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats anythin&rsquo; I ever heard of,&rdquo; he at length
declared. &ldquo;Though I knew you were goin&rsquo; to rig up
in some way, I thought the real Ira had stolen a
march on us, an&rsquo; got into camp&mdash;leastwise, you seemed
like the real Ira to me, though I&rsquo;ve never set eyes on
him. Unless the red-coats know him better than I
do, they&rsquo;ll take you for him, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is possible more than one of the
British officers may know Le Geyt,&rdquo; the lad said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;or some person come into the lines
who has seen him. But I think the risk is small.
His visits to this part of the state have not been frequent,
and, while his name is familiar, his face and
form are not. I flatter myself I have a make-up that
quite resembles him, and believe I can successfully
carry out the part. Let us have breakfast, and then
I will be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he dropped his pack beside the gun,
and, going to the fire, helped himself to the smoking
food. Joe followed his example, and they ate almost
in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The meal finished, Ira removed his huge boots,
and, adding them to his bundle, started down the
brook. His comrade followed as far as the great
maple, and from there watched, as he, after resuming
his foot-gear, walked slowly toward the British camp.</p>
<p>He would have been greatly excited had he witnessed
what befell the traveler a few moments later.
Emerging from the ravine, he had gone but a few
rods when a stalwart Indian leaped from a thicket
and grasped him by the shoulder. The next instant
a half-dozen more surrounded him. Though offering
no violence, it was clear they intended to make him
a prisoner.</p>
<p>Instead of being disturbed by this mishap, the
captive seemed to rejoice over it. He smiled pleasantly,
laid his hand gently on the shoulder of the
man who first seized him, and who was apparently
the chief of the party, saying in the native tongue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, you are from the great camp by the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grunt of assent came from the captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me there at once,&rdquo; the prisoner continued
with some show of authority. &ldquo;I have important
business with General Burgoyne, the commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were not without their effect. Releasing
him, the Indian said in a tone of inquiry: &ldquo;Ira
Le Geyt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ira Le Geyt,&rdquo; the youth repeated, and at the
same moment he drew from the bosom of his coat the
iron cross.</p>
<p>At sight of the bit of metal the chieftain gave a
peremptory order to his men to fall in behind him,
and then, side by side with the captured lad, strode
away towards the encampment.</p>
<p>They were not long in reaching the first outpost.
To the guard the Indian uttered the two English
words, &ldquo;King George,&rdquo; and was allowed to pass with
his entire party.</p>
<p>Once within the lines the chief sent his followers
to their quarters, and then led his companion swiftly
across the enclosure to the tent of the commander,
which he entered without ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General! Ira Le Geyt!&rdquo; he said, and then
vanished.</p>
<p>Two men turned to face the newcomer; one in the
uniform of a major-general, the other in the garb of
a private citizen, for their backs had been toward
the entrance, while they were giving undivided attention
to a rude map or chart which was spread out
upon the camp bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon for this intrusion, General
Burgoyne,&rdquo; the young scout began, bowing low before
that officer, &ldquo;It was due to my conductor, one
of your Indians, who ran on me in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right, Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; the commander
replied good-naturedly. &ldquo;Indeed, your coming is
most timely. My companion, who, by the way is
Master George Preston, a courier who came from
Quebec with us, and is to go on to New York with
a message for General Clinton from Lord Germain,
and I, were trying to trace out on this map the
best route for him to follow down the river. Perhaps
you, who, I am informed, are familiar with this
entire region, may be able to help us. Would you
advise him to take the east or west side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira stepped to the bed, ostensibly to examine the
map, which proved to be a crude and inaccurate affair,
but really to gain time in which to think over the
situation. Here was work for him immediately. If
this man had a message for General Clinton from
Lord Germain, the War Secretary in London, it was
altogether too important to be allowed to reach its
destination. But how should he prevent it, and obtain
possession of the paper?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>He cast a furtive glance at the courier to ascertain
the kind of man he had to deal with. The look was
hardly reassuring. Clearly George Preston was not
a man to be easily thwarted. Forty years of age,
nearly a giant in strength and stature, with a face
that suggested courage, resourcefulness, and faithfulness
to duty. It was certain he had been selected for
the task assigned him because he could be thoroughly
relied upon.</p>
<p>All this the lad took in during the brief minute he
stood silent, and at once decided upon a plan which
he believed would enable him to accomplish his purpose.
Then he said in answer to the question asked
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, sir. He better make directly for the river
from here, and, crossing it, go down the west side
until below Albany. Then, recrossing it, follow the
east side to his destination. In this way he will
escape the main forces of the enemy, and so lessen
his chances of being captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I told you, Master Preston!&rdquo; exclaimed
the general in triumph. &ldquo;I need the aid of
Clinton too badly to run any risk of your message
failing to reach him. Take the safer way, even
though it involves a longer journey. Twenty-four
hours delay in the delivery of the letter is nothing,
if it in the end reaches the general.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;My chief objection to the plan lies in this:&rdquo; the
courier said quietly. &ldquo;It is unlike the route laid
out for me in St. John. I had rather obey the letter,
as well as the spirit, of my orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good practice, truly,&rdquo; General Burgoyne replied
heartily, &ldquo;and one that proves you are the man
for this work. But our friends in St. John did not
know what might arise, and therefore left you to your
own judgment. I am exceedingly anxious that you
use every precaution possible to carry Lord Germain&rsquo;s
message safely through the enemy&rsquo;s lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot be more anxious than I,&rdquo; Master
Preston said calmly, &ldquo;and I have something more to
say, provided our friend here is all he claims to be.
It may be over-caution on my part, but if I recollect
rightly, he has nothing but the word of that Indian
to back him,&rdquo; and he gave the officer a glance which
caused him to flush slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Le Geyt answered so fully the description
I had received of him,&rdquo; the general replied somewhat
haughtily, &ldquo;that I was at once satisfied he was all
he claimed to be. Nor is the Indian&rsquo;s word of so
little value as you seem to think. He must have
known the young man, or he would never have brought
him here. But since you have your doubts, he can,
I am sure, show what will convince us that he is as
trustworthy as yourself,&rdquo; and he glanced confidently
at the youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, General Burgoyne, for so much confidence
in me,&rdquo; Ira replied, &ldquo;and I commend the caution
of Master Preston. He has a perfect right to
demand full proof of my identity before giving me
any information which might be of value to an enemy.
I will then, with your permission, hand him my
credentials first,&rdquo; and, ripping open the lining of
his coat, he took out two slips of paper, which he gave
to the courier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first is my commission as a scout from the
general here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The second is from
our good friend, Lord Germain, and bears his official
seal. You will see that he vouches for my loyalty,
and suggests that General Burgoyne employ me during
this campaign. I believe it was this paper that
led the general to send me the other, though he had
never seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also had a personal note from the Secretary,
giving me a description of you, and setting forth in
detail how you could be of special service to me,&rdquo; the
commander hastened to add. &ldquo;Are you satisfied,
Master Preston?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be,&rdquo; the latter declared, &ldquo;and to prove
it I will now make a disclosure, general, which I
have up to this time withheld, even from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he took a small package from his coat
pocket, and opening it, brought to view three papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the letter to Sir Henry Clinton;
this is my passport into any and all of our army
lines; and this is the document I wish to show you.
You will notice, General Burgoyne, that our friends
at St. John were not in ignorance of the best route
for me to follow in going to Yew York, and also will
understand the real reason why I hold for the path
they have marked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfolding the paper with these words of explanation,
he showed his companions a carefully prepared
route of the entire distance he was to travel. Each
day&rsquo;s journey was laid out; every stopping place,
with the name of his host, was written down, and,
now and then, beside a name was a peculiar mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Note these references,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are concerning
those men who are to give me special tidings
as to the number and position of the rebels in their
vicinity. James Graham of Hubbardtown, where I
make my first stop, will tell me the latest news about
Fort Ticonderoga; William Erskine will report as to
the condition of affairs about Fort Edward. The
other men will in turn post me about matters in their
neighborhood, so that when I reach my destination I
expect to be the bearer of information to General
Clinton which will greatly aid him in despatching a
force up the river to join you at Albany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking Ira had read and fixed
in his memory the names of the men who were to
assist the courier. He knew some as rank Tories, but
there were others who had the reputation of being
friendly to the Cause, and, therefore, were allowed to
come and go freely in the encampments near them.
This revelation of their true character he regarded of
sufficient value to repay him for all the risk he had
run in entering the British camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not thought of that, Master Preston,&rdquo; the
commander admitted. &ldquo;The additional information
you gain may be worth the chances you take in following
that route. It is clear the authorities at St. John
believed it would be. But I advise you to travel
only in the night, and lay quietly in quarters during
the day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely what I have planned to do, general.
Leaving here to-night I count, unless I lose my way,
to reach the house of Master Graham before sunrise.
After that I shall have no trouble, for, if need be,
a guide can be furnished me from station to
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you may have a guide to Master Graham&rsquo;s
door,&rdquo; the young scout said modestly. &ldquo;That is, if
you are willing to accept my humble services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am, and thank you for the favor,&rdquo;
the courier answered heartily. &ldquo;It removes the only
anxiety I had about this first stage of my journey.
We will start about nine o&rsquo;clock, if that suits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, General Burgoyne, can have your letter
to Sir Henry ready by that time?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I hope you have some safer place than
your pocket for it and those other papers,&rdquo; the general
replied, as Master Preston began to wrap up the
documents he had exhibited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t borrow any trouble on that score, my dear
sir,&rdquo; the man replied with a peculiar smile. &ldquo;I may
be captured, and my garments picked to pieces, but I
assure you the missives will not be found,&rdquo; which
declaration was credited by one, and doubted by his
other hearer.</p>
<p>An orderly now appeared, saying that General
Fraser was without and desired an interview with the
commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Show him in,&rdquo; was the reply of that officer, and
then, turning to his other visitors, he added, &ldquo;I shall
be busy during the remainder of the day, but an half-hour
before you begin your journey I will be glad
to see both of you here. The tent at the right, Master
Le Geyt, has been prepared for you,&rdquo; and then he
turned to greet his subordinate, who had already
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall spend some hours in a much needed rest,&rdquo;
the young scout announced to his companion, when
they were outside; &ldquo;but will join you at sundown, if
you so desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call for you when I come to report to the
general,&rdquo; Master Preston replied, and then hastened
off to his own quarters.</p>
<p>Ira left his tent but once during the day. That
was just after dinner, and for a stroll in the forest.
He was absent about two hours, and on his return
brought a fine string of trout he had caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A present for the general,&rdquo; he said to the courier,
whom he chanced to meet soon after he entered the
lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had taken me with you,&rdquo; the latter
cried enthusiastically as he inspected the speckled
beauties. &ldquo;If there is anything I enjoy more than
running the lines of the enemy, it is angling, and you
have the finest catch I have ever seen in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that shall be a bond between us,&rdquo; was the
hearty response. &ldquo;I knew of a pool a mile or two
from here, and could not resist the temptation to pull
out a string. You&rsquo;ll be here in a few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Master Preston, strolling on, apparently
unsuspicious that his new acquaintance had
been out of the camp for any other purpose than
that of fishing.</p>
<p>Their interview with General Burgoyne during
evening was brief. He gave a letter he had prepared
for General Clinton, to Master Preston, who asked
to be excused for a few moments. Somewhere in the
outer darkness he concealed it about him, for when
he returned he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put it with the others, sir, and promise you
that it shall not fall into any hand than that for
which it is intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he and his guide had left the
encampment, and were gliding swiftly and noiselessly
through the forest toward Master Graham&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Several times the heavy step as of some belated
traveler caused them to shrink back under the cover
of the dense brush until it had ceased. Now and
then came the cry of some wild beast to startle them,
but they kept steadily along the trail until nearly
midnight. Then they had arrived at a small brook,
which crossed the path at right angles, and here Ira,
who was in the lead, stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our journey is half done,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We
may as well halt here, and have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a rock beside the stream, amid darkness that
could almost be felt, surrounded by a silence that
seemed oppressive, the two in silence partook of the
food they had brought with them. Quenching their
thirst from the rivulet, they were about to resume
their tramp, when came the hoot of an owl from the
rear. It was repeated at a short distance down the
trail, and a moment later sounded nearer yet, but from
up the brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be we are followed and surrounded?&rdquo; the
courier asked apprehensively in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a singular circumstance,&rdquo; his companion admitted
in a whisper. &ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; and,
listening, they heard the cries again in precisely the
same order. Then came the sharp snap of a twig
as though some one was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way is open to the right,&rdquo; Ira continued in
the same low tone. &ldquo;Quick! we may yet escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>He led the way down the stream, going as rapidly
as the darkness and underbrush would permit, his
comrade keeping close at his heels. After a while the
ground became soft and miry, and the bushes were so
dense as to render progress exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take to the brook,&rdquo; Ira said to his companion.
&ldquo;Pull off your boots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it necessary?&rdquo; the courier asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
we wait here awhile, and then go back to the trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; was the answer. Through the stillness
of the night came to their ears the sound of
footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; the young scout whispered to Master
Preston. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take to the stream here, and keep
it down a few rods to where another brook joins it,
which last we&rsquo;ll follow. It will enable us to work
toward the old trail, and at the same time throw our
pursuers off the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping into the water a moment later, they waded
slowly and cautiously along to the tributary of which
Ira had spoken. Entering this they began its ascent.
During a half hour they kept on, pausing occasionally
to learn if they were still followed, but no sound
broke the stillness of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows have lost our trail; can&rsquo;t we leave
the brook now?&rdquo; the courier at length asked, becoming
tired of his slippery and uncertain footing.</p>
<p>His companion&rsquo;s answer was also a question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Preston stepped beside his guide, and then
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fire of some kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camp-fire,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;I can now
see a tent beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep straight on. Whoever may be there are
probably fast asleep at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noiselessly they advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a pond,&rdquo; the courier whispered an instant
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; his companion agreed, &ldquo;and that
is Boulder island. I know where we are now. I
don&rsquo;t think we have anything to fear, still we&rsquo;ll keep
our guns ready for immediate use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment they gained the shore of the island,
and stopped in front of the fire, at the tent door.
The canvas dwelling was empty.</p>
<p>Ira laughed loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a joke on us!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;See!
there are the fellows&rsquo; fishing rods. They were doubtless
out hunting when night came on, became separated,
and are trying to find each other and their
camp. We&rsquo;ve run away from men who had no thought
of pursuing us,&rdquo; and again he laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Before his comrade could speak a cry came from
the main shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there! Who are you in our camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know that voice,&rdquo; the young scout
said to the courier. Then he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira Le Geyt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came back across the little pond.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll jine ye in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a noise as of splashing water for a moment,
and then two young lads came into the dim
light of the camp-fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Ira,&rdquo; they both exclaimed, shaking
hands with him, and he introduced his companion
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Preston, this is Joe Fisher and Late
Wentworth, two friends of mine, who are of the right
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the courier had acknowledged the introduction,
his guide continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it you who were hooting like owls up where
the stream crosses the Hubbardtown trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Late replied. &ldquo;We were separated, an&rsquo;
tryin&rsquo; to come together again. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it was some one who wanted to hem
us in on the trail, and so took to the brook,&rdquo; the
young scout explained, &ldquo;and here we are, three or
four miles out of our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ye better stay until mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Joe said.
&ldquo;You are both welcome to our shelter an&rsquo; fodder,
such as it is. Ain&rsquo;t that so, Late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; his camp-mate replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if we
don&rsquo;t turn in soon, mornin&rsquo; will be here &rsquo;fore we get
a wink of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave it to you, Master Preston,&rdquo; Ira said.
&ldquo;Shall we go on, or stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I must reach my destination
before light, if it is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; his guide replied, stooping to pick
up the big boots he had thrown down upon reaching
camp.</p>
<p>The courier bent over for the same purpose, but
before he could recover himself, Late and Joe seized
and threw him to the ground. Ira came to their
aid, and in a few moments the man was bound and
disarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded with an
ugly glance at the young scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I want the papers you carry,&rdquo; Ira replied
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find them then,&rdquo; he retorted with a grin.</p>
<p>His clothing was examined, his boots, hat, belt, the
stocks of his pistols and gun; but the important
papers could not be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">THE SPIKED CANNON.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put him in the tent, and make further
search in the morning,&rdquo; Ira said at length.</p>
<p>The three scouts lifted their prisoner, and, carrying
him into the tent, laid him gently on the fir
boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would loosen your bonds if it were safe to do
so, Master Preston,&rdquo; Ira said; &ldquo;but as it is, you
will have to make yourself as comfortable as possible
under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in a worse fix,&rdquo; he replied shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may both lie down and get what sleep you
can,&rdquo; the lad then said to his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the one to sleep; we&rsquo;ll take turns watching
the prisoner,&rdquo; Late said stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; their leader answered decisively. &ldquo;You
will have a long journey to-morrow and need the rest,
while I can sleep after returning to the encampment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>They yielded reluctantly, and were soon slumbering
soundly. Ten minutes passed, and the courier was
so quiet the lone watchman thought he too must be
asleep; but suddenly he tried to raise himself, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Ira asked kindly. &ldquo;Can I do
anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the captive answered. &ldquo;Tell me whether
you are really Le Geyt, or some one who is personating
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does that make to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much. If you are Le Geyt, you are a low, contemptible
traitor, and when I get the chance I&rsquo;ll crush
your life out as I would that of a snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling that way,&rdquo; Ira replied
with a slight laugh. &ldquo;I should in your place.
But what if I am not Le Geyt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The courier struggled until he had raised himself
slightly on one elbow, and looked straight at his
captor for a moment. Then he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are some Yankee personating him at General
Burgoyne&rsquo;s headquarters, I say it is the boldest
scheme I ever heard of, and I have only the profoundest
respect for you. To be outwitted by such a man
isn&rsquo;t half as bad as having a sneaking traitor get the
best of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is where the shoe pinches, is it?&rdquo; the young
scout asked with another laugh. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll let you
judge as to my real character by this night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence reigned for some time, to be broken again
by Master Preston, who said, as if he had been thinking
over the events of the night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not far from the British camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not gone long enough from the encampment
during the afternoon to have traveled very far
and also caught that string of fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good reasoner, Master Preston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we haven&rsquo;t been very far from the
camp at any time to-night,&rdquo; the prisoner went on a
moment or two later in tones of disgust. &ldquo;I wonder
I didn&rsquo;t suspect you were leading me in a circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circle was too large, and you were not familiar
enough with the locality to see the change in our
course,&rdquo; Ira explained. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be blamed, I
assure you. The way you have hidden the letters I
know you carry, is proof you are nobody&rsquo;s fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compliment evidently pleased the prisoner,
for he laughed silently, and then remarked significantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found them yet, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Ira made no answer, and in a few minutes the
prisoner was sleeping soundly notwithstanding his uncomfortable
situation.</p>
<p>The little camp was astir early, for Dan Cushing
arrived at dawn from Fort Edward. He looked the
prisoner over, heard the story of his capture, and then
turned to Late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday about noon,&rdquo; his friend replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any special news at Ticonderoga?&rdquo; he next inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, except General St. Clair has over three
thousand men,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Colonel Seth Warner
has come with his regiment from Bennington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And General Schuyler is gettin&rsquo; reinforcements
all the time,&rdquo; Dan announced. &ldquo;Give him a little
more time, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll have ten thousand men at his
back, &rsquo;nough to drive the red-coats back into Lake
Champlain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have the needed time before Burgoyne
reaches him,&rdquo; Ira declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what the general told me to tell you,&rdquo; the
lad continued. &ldquo;He will leave the road open to
Fort Edward until General St. Clair finds out
whether he will have to retreat from Ticonderoga. If
he does, he is to destroy bridges, and cut down trees
across the way to hinder the red-coats as much as
possible. I carried that order to him before comin&rsquo;
back, else I&rsquo;d been here sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here in time,&rdquo; the leader replied, &ldquo;though
I shall have to send you back to the fort in a few
hours. I want our prisoner in the custody of General
Schuyler, rather than that of General St. Clair.
I shall feel safer. And all three of you will make
none too strong a guard. He must not be allowed
to escape under any circumstances. Shoot him down
should he attempt it. But we&rsquo;ll have breakfast first,
and then search him again for those missing messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a half-hour they and their prisoner had eaten.
Then the latter was stripped to the skin, and every
rag of his clothing examined. Then his boots and
weapons were again inspected, lest some secret cavity
had been overlooked. But the search was as fruitless
as the previous one. It was evident that the captive
enjoyed their discomfiture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; Ira finally declared. &ldquo;As long
as he is a prisoner he cannot deliver the letters, and
that will answer our purpose. It is possible, too,
that the general may find a way to make him disclose
their hiding place. At noon you are to begin your
journey. Take the west trail to the river, and keep on
to the fort. When you go, I&rsquo;ll start for the British
camp. Until then Dan and I will sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noon-day sun, therefore, looked down upon a
deserted island. The three boys with their prisoner
had gone over to the western shore of the little pond,
and from there struck through the forest towards the
Hudson river; while Ira re-crossed to the brook, and,
descending that to the larger stream, retraced his steps
to the point where the latter met the Hubbardtown
trail. From this point he began his journey back to
the lake. He took such a roundabout route as a precautionary
step. Should he meet any one who knew
him, it would be supposed he was returning to the
encampment directly from Master Graham&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>On his arrival he found General Burgoyne too busy
with his arrangements for breaking camp on the
morrow to give him more than a passing notice.</p>
<p>Greeting him pleasantly, the officer remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that you made a safe journey, Master Le
Geyt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, and left Master Preston in good hands,&rdquo;
he replied, an answer which satisfied the unsuspecting
commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>By easy stages the army crept down toward Ticonderoga
until only Sugar Loaf Mountain<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> stood between
it and the fortress. Here a halt was called
that the engineering corps might examine the hill with
a view to placing a half-dozen cannon on its summit.</p>
<p>With some anxiety Ira went over to the officer who
was watching his men as they clambered up the steep
sides, measuring distances, and selecting the surest
footing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a difficult place to carry guns, captain,&rdquo; he
said, as he stood by the officer&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;The enemy
have always regarded such a feat as being impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be for them, but not for us,&rdquo; the Britisher
replied loftily. &ldquo;Before night I shall have my cannon
yonder on that level spot you see below the big
tree. From there it will be an easy task to run them
over on the south side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fort will then be at your mercy,&rdquo; the young
scout suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the captain replied with much satisfaction.
&ldquo;As soon as I have the guns in place, the general
will throw his army about the fortress, and it will
have to surrender, or be blown to pieces. The cannon
isn&rsquo;t yet made that can throw a shot six hundred
feet straight up in the air to harm us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; the lad admitted, and turned away
with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>From his tent door he could watch the work of the
engineers. A derrick was made of a tree some distance
up the precipitous side; a pair of horses was attached
to one end of the rope, and a gun drawn up
to a level spot which had been cleared away a few
feet below the tree. Then the tackling was carried
to another improvised derrick farther up the hill,
and again the horses swung the cannon toward the
summit. It was a slow task, often beset with unexpected
hindrance; but within two hours the first
gun was lying on the level spot which the captain of
the corps had designated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one cannon may be put there, six can be made
to follow,&rdquo; muttered Ira as he saw the end of the
task. &ldquo;It is only a question of time. The officer
was right; before night he will have his battery where
it can be put in place. I must get word to General
St. Clair, and let him and his men slip away before
they are surrounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opportunity came to him unexpectedly. About
dusk General Burgoyne sent for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; he said, when the young scout
was in his presence, &ldquo;I want you to go below the fort
and keep watch over the road the enemy would take
if they should attempt to retreat to-night. Select as
many men with you as may be needed, and in case you
discover any suspicious movement, report promptly to
General Fraser. He has his division ready for immediate
pursuit the moment we know the Yankees are
trying to escape us. Before another night I shall
have a force where they cannot leave the fort however
great their desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concealing the exultation he felt at this order, the
lad replied promptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make arrangements to leave camp at once,
general, and shall need but one other man, provided
we may have horses. There are two routes by which
the Yankees can leave the fort; my comrade can watch
one, while I look after the other, and the first to detect
any movement of the enemy will report at once to
General Fraser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Go to Colonel Baume; he will furnish
you with horses and man, and you can be off by
the time it is fairly dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the lad hurried away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Twenty minutes later he rode out of the lines, accompanied
by a stolid Hessian whom he had chosen as
his attendant. They went down the south road until
arriving at another running westward. Here he
stationed his comrade, saying to him in his own
tongue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here until I return, unless the Yankees come
along in full force, in which case you are to ride to
camp as fast as your horse will go, and tell your
colonel. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted an assent, and Ira rode off to the east,
saying to himself: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see no Yankee force to-night,
my good fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mile further on he came to a farm-house, up
to which he rode boldly, and dismounted. Three
rapid knocks on the door brought an immediate response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in a moment,&rdquo; a voice said, and
soon a stalwart form stepped from the darkness
within into the darkness without. Approaching the
horseman, he peered into his face an instant, and then
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Ira! It is you! Well, what is up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go into the fort to-night,&rdquo; the rider explained
in low tones. &ldquo;I will leave my horse here.
What is the password?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The man placed his lips to the lad&rsquo;s ear, and
whispered the information he desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I will be back in a few
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then gave the reins of his steed into the farmer&rsquo;s
hands, and, passing around the house, crossed an
open field to the nearest thicket, into which he
plunged. When he emerged from the timber he was
near the fortress. Boldly approaching the sentinel,
he replied to the challenge by giving the password,
and in a few minutes was in the presence of General
St. Clair.</p>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s greeting was a warm one. Grasping
the newcomer by the hand, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here he hesitated a
moment, and then went on with a grimace, as though
the name was a disagreeable one to him&mdash;&ldquo;Ira; but
I fear your coming means bad news for me. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no time to find my messengers,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;so came myself. The engineers of Burgoyne have
succeeded in hoisting six of their best cannon up the
north side of Sugar Loaf Mountain. To-morrow
morning they will be run across to the south edge,
and the fort will be at their mercy. You must retreat
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, it means leaving my cannon and stores
for the enemy,&rdquo; the general growled, more to himself
than to his visitor. &ldquo;Tell me how they did it? I
thought such a plan impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly the young scout described the methods
used to accomplish the feat, and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also have another item of news. General Fraser&rsquo;s
division is in readiness to pursue you, if you
attempt to leave the fortification. I have been sent
here to see that you do not get away,&rdquo; and he and the
officer laughed. &ldquo;The general has orders to put his
troops in your rear in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! hum!&rdquo; the commander muttered. &ldquo;That
does look as though I must move quickly, if I am to
save my men for future fighting,&rdquo; and he relapsed
into deep thought.</p>
<p>In silence Ira waited. At length the general spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could have until to-morrow night, I believe
it might be possible to slip away with men, guns,
stores, everything. Is there any way by which the
movements of the red-coats could be delayed, say for
twenty-four hours?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It was a full minute before the lad replied: Then
he said slowly: &ldquo;If those cannon on the mountain
were disabled, they would have to spend another day
hoisting up a second battery, and in all probability
General Fraser would not be sent to your rear until
the guns were in position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; broke in the officer eagerly, &ldquo;if those
guns can be spiked to-night, I am likely to secure the
delay I need. Now the question is, can it be done?
Are those cannon under guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; his visitor replied. &ldquo;The British
camp is so close to the foot of the hill, and as you are
not supposed to know that the guns are on its summit,
they have not deemed such a precaution necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worth trying,&rdquo; the commander said half to
himself. &ldquo;If I can only find a man who is willing
to undertake the job,&rdquo; and again he relapsed into
deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will undertake it, general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe I can do it without much risk.
Once I climbed that hill from this side, just for the
pleasure of saying I had accomplished the feat. I
am sure I can do it again. Give me the implements
needed; say nothing to any one, and I will make the
attempt. Two cries of a night-hawk from the south
edge of the mountain, twice repeated, will be token
that I have succeeded. Three cries, unrepeated, is
that I have failed. There will be time for you to slip
away with your men if I am obliged to report a
failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During several minutes they discussed the matter,
General St. Clair offering to send others to perform
the task, and the lad insisting that he be allowed to try
it. In the end the officer yielded, and, with a hammer
and files in his pockets, the young scout left the fortress.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in gaining the steep side of
the mountain. It was there the hazardous work
began. For some moments Ira studied the rocks as
best he could in the darkness. Finally he gave an exclamation
of delight. He was certain he had hit upon
the place where he began his ascent several months
previous.</p>
<p>Up the cliff, using hands and feet in every crevice
he could find, grasping narrow ledge, or projecting
root as he came to them, stopping to rest at intervals,
he clambered slowly on. A half-hour passed, and
then the toiler&rsquo;s efforts were rewarded. He gained a
ledge from which he found safe footing to the summit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Drawing a deep breath of relief, he sped noiselessly
to the opposite side. Finding the guns unguarded, he
commenced the work which he believed meant so much
to his friends in the fort. Wrapping a bit of cloth
about a file, and placing his folded handkerchief over
the top to deaden the sound, he drove it into the touch-hole
of the nearest cannon.</p>
<p>The task accomplished, he listened attentively.
There was no token that his work had attracted the
attention of any one in the British camp six hundred
feet below. Congratulating himself on such supposed
fact, he moved on to the next gun, and set firmly a
second file. Again he listened, but could hear
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sound does not reach the camp,&rdquo; he said to
himself, and as rapidly as possible disabled the other
four cannon. Straightening up from the labor, he
found himself face to face with the captain of the
engineer corps, who demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rejoicing that he had not yet been recognized, Ira,
with quick wit, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am watching the guns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was not aware we posted any guard here to-night,&rdquo;
the officer said sharply. &ldquo;Unless you can
give a better reason for being here I shall run you
through,&rdquo; and there could be heard a certain rustling
which told that he was drawing his sword from its
scabbard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general sent me,&rdquo; the lad replied, not thinking
it worth while to explain what general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the officer stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think
a sentinel was necessary here. I received no orders to
that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing to me,&rdquo; was the cool reply.</p>
<p>This answer appeared to anger the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I heard a hammering up here,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. I was pounding on the guns. A
man must do something to keep himself awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer apparently satisfied the officer, for
he turned to retrace his steps down the mountain
side. After going a few paces, however, he paused to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may tell the general that I came up here myself
to see if the guns were all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fair,&rdquo; the young scout agreed, wondering
if the officer had recognized him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>He stood motionless until every sound of footsteps
had died away. Then he hurried across the summit
and gave utterance to the cries which told the listening
Yankee general that he had succeeded in his undertaking.</p>
<p>But that gratified officer little fancied that the lad
was even then mentally asking if it was safe for him
to return to the British camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE DAM ACROSS THE CREEK.</span></h2>
<p>Ira did not stop to debate the question there on
the mountain top. He had a more difficult problem,
which was, how to descend in safety to the plain
below.</p>
<p>Down the slanting shelf to the face of the cliff, he
slowly groped his way; and then lowered himself inch
by inch down the rocks. Sometimes he was forced to
cling with his hands to a bush or sapling while he
swung to and fro in search of a footing. Often he
was forced to guess what was below him, and, at a
venture, drop himself down where he believed he
would find a crevice large enough for his feet. It
was many minutes, and to him it must have seemed
hours, before he gained a place from which he could
descend without danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Once at the foot of the hill he ran quickly through
the woods, to the place where he had left his horse.
The farmer answered his summons quickly, and the
lad was astonished when once within the house, to
learn that it was only a few minutes past midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sleep until three o&rsquo;clock, Master Lewis,
if you don&rsquo;t mind calling me at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that much for one who has been through
what you have,&rdquo; the farmer replied with a significant
glance at his guest&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>Ira smiled. &ldquo;My garments are a bit soiled and
torn,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I hope they will look a little
better before I go back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a woman&rsquo;s voice could be heard from the next
room. &ldquo;Let him go into the front chamber, pa, and
send his clothes here by you. I will clean and mend
them while he sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, good mistress,&rdquo; the lad cried. &ldquo;It
is a case where a woman&rsquo;s hands can help me out of
an awkward fix. Under your skilful fingers I shall
be able to return to the British encampment without a
trace of the work I have done this night for the
Cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was he disappointed. It would have required
sharp eyes, indeed, to have discovered any evidences
of mountain climbing upon his clothing when he
dressed himself a little before dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>A sharp ride down the road brought him to the
place where he had left the Hessian. He found the
fellow fast asleep in a thicket, his horse hitched to a
near-by tree. Waking him, he asked in well-feigned
anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there, Hans, how long has this been going
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trooper arose, rubbed his eyes sleepily, and
stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I had only just laid down, sir. I knew it was
most morning, when the Yankees wouldn&rsquo;t be likely
to come now, and I was so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times did I ride back here during the
night, then?&rdquo; Ira demanded sternly.</p>
<p>The man looked puzzled for a moment, and then
answered boldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times, sir. I saw you every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young scout laughed heartily. &ldquo;There is an
old saying in our language, Hans, to the effect that
&lsquo;a lie well stuck to is as good as the truth.&rsquo; It may
prove so in your case. Mount, and we&rsquo;ll ride back
to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The sun was rising when they passed the pickets,
and the first person they saw beyond the guards was
the captain of the engineer corps. He was viewing
his work of the previous day. Seeing the horsemen,
he crossed the enclosure to meet them. Understanding
his purpose, and eager for the interview, Ira
reined his horse down to a walk. They soon met, and
the officer was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have taken an early ride this morning,
Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an all-night job,&rdquo; the scout replied in a
friendly tone. &ldquo;Hans and I have been five or six
miles out into the country doing special work for the
king. I am on my way now to report to the general,&rdquo;
and, putting spurs to his horse, he, followed by his attendant,
rode to the tent of the commander.</p>
<p>There he gave his steed over to the care of the
trooper, who went off to his own quarters. Watching
him, while he stood waiting to be admitted to the
presence of General Burgoyne, Ira saw that the engineer
halted and held quite an extended conversation
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certain he thought he saw me on the hill,&rdquo;
the lad muttered; &ldquo;but he won&rsquo;t be so sure of it
after talking with the Hessian. On finding that the
guns have been spiked, he&rsquo;ll be in such a muddle that
there&rsquo;ll be nothing said about our meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>This prophecy was not quite correct. There was a
single exception. The engineer did mention the affair
to Ira himself. Calling on him that evening, after
the second battery had been hoisted up on the
mountain, he first enjoined the utmost secrecy, and
then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a peculiar experience last night in connection
with that first battery. About ten o&rsquo;clock I was
enjoying a smoke, when I heard a muffled click, click,
up the mountain side. Wondering what was going
on, I climbed up, and found a fellow of about your
size standing by the cannon. When I asked his business,
he said he was guarding the guns; that the general
had sent him there. I was certain then that it
was you, and felt quite sore because I had failed to
post a guard. Hoping to put myself right with the
commander, I said that he should tell the general I
was up there to see that the cannon were safe. He
promised to do so, and I returned to the camp. The
first inkling I had that it wasn&rsquo;t you, came when I
saw you and the Hessian riding into the lines. I
never once suspected it might be some blasted Yankee,
until my men reported that the guns had been spiked.
To think that I talked with the rascal, and yet he was
sharp enough to hoodwink me, fairly makes me boil.
Why, I one time had my sword drawn, and could
have run him through, but yet let him go. Don&rsquo;t tell
any one that I have been such a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I shan&rsquo;t mention the incident to
a single soul,&rdquo; was the truthful promise.</p>
<p>Elated as Ira was at his own escape from detection,
he rejoiced even more because General St. Clair had
gained the delay in the movements of the enemy which
he had so much desired. General Burgoyne, when he
found he could not command the fort until a second
battery had been placed on the hill, countermanded
the order given General Fraser to advance his division
to the rear of the Continentals.</p>
<p>It was not until a Tory, living on the Hubbardtown
road, came into the camp in the small hours of July
fifth, with the startling tidings that the Yankees were
running off bag and baggage past his house, that a new
order was issued for the waiting forces to move. As
the bearer of the news offered to act as guide, the
young scout was not disturbed, and, therefore, it was
not until after sunrise that he knew pursuit had been
made. He waited in much anxiety for the outcome,
and was filled with dismay when at noon a report
came that General Fraser had overtaken and defeated
the retreating Yankees, capturing enormous
quantities of ammunition and stores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>He learned the real facts about the battle, however,
a little later, and from the lips of Dan Cushing. He
had gone to meet his aids in a deep cave on a rocky
hill a mile or two below the British encampment, and
arrived there just in time to meet Dan, who had come
from where the engagement took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Ira, &rsquo;bout the braggin&rsquo; those
red-coats are doin&rsquo; in the camp,&rdquo; the boy began.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make a mole-hill look like a mountain any
time, &rsquo;specially if it&rsquo;s in their favor. Now, the facts
are these, an&rsquo; I have them from some of the fellers
who were in the fight: General St. Clair left Colonel
Seth Warren&rsquo;s regiment in the rear to look out for
the British if they came chasin&rsquo; down after him. He
was on the Hubbardtown and Castleton road when
General Fraser overtook him. To give the main
portion of the forces a chance to escape, the Colonel
turned and pitched into the red-coats. What&rsquo;s more,
he would have whipped them, had not a reserved
force of Hessians come up in the nick of time. That
turned the tide in the British favor, and our men had
to run, but they got away as did the others ahead of
them. Our people are tearin&rsquo; up the bridges, an&rsquo;
droppin&rsquo; great trees &rsquo;cross the road as they go, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; General Burgoyne will go mighty slow
&rsquo;tween here an&rsquo; Fort Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a scheme in mind that will do more to
hinder him than destroying bridges or felling trees,&rdquo;
the leader said when the story was finished; &ldquo;but we
can&rsquo;t carry it out until we are several miles below
here, near our next meeting-place. When you move
down to it, provide yourselves with pick-axes, shovels,
and iron bars. I&rsquo;ll get a day off in some way, and
though we will have as hard and as big a job as we
ever undertook, I doubt if we&rsquo;ll ever do another turn
that will mean more for the Cause,&rdquo; and with this
mystifying statement he hurried away.</p>
<p>A week passed. During that time General Burgoyne
garrisoned the abandoned fort at Ticonderoga,
and moved his main force down the Hubbardtown
road. His progress was necessarily slow, since he
was compelled to clear the way, and rebuild bridges
before he could make any headway. At length he
arrived at a passage between two hills, so narrow and
so completely blocked with logs and bowlders, that it
was evident his engineering corps had at least a two-days
task to remove the obstruction. Here his patience
became exhausted, and he sent for Ira.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; he said when the young scout
was in his presence, &ldquo;I am tired of this snail&rsquo;s pace
at which I am obliged to crawl. Is there not some
other route I could follow, and so get rid of these
obstacles the rebels have thrown in my way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide shook his head. &ldquo;Not without a long
detour which would consume more time than clearing
the way,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;There is a big swamp on
ahead, and the only hope of getting through it is to
keep along this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there not at least some way we can get around
these hills?&rdquo; continued the exasperated commander.
&ldquo;Even if we are twenty-four hours doing it we shall
save time. Captain Howell of my engineering corps
declares it will take two days, if not longer, to remove
these latest obstructions we have encountered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It suddenly occurred to Ira that here might be his
opportunity to get a few hours to himself, as he had
been hoping to do, therefore he replied quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might take a tramp around the hills and see.
It&rsquo;s worth looking into, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would, and take Captain Howell with
you. He can readily reckon the length of time required
to clear the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was something on which the lad had not
counted; but if disturbed by it, he gave no sign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I will see the
captain at once, and get away as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is odd,&rdquo; he said to himself while searching for
the officer, &ldquo;that I should for the second time be
forced to fool that man. But I must do it, if I&rsquo;m to
accomplish the job on hand, and it&rsquo;s time it was attended
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had formed no definite plan of action when he
found the captain, and they began their tramp
together through the forest. It was just after noon,
and they went to the eastward, as the hill on that side
of the road seemed more likely, from its shape, to
have a pass through it.</p>
<p>This proved to be a fact. After walking two miles
they arrived at a narrow valley, through which ran a
small brook. Following this they came into some
lowlands, over which they made their way to the road
at a point where it wound into a swamp heavily
wooded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are beyond the great barricade,&rdquo; the captain
announced as they stepped out upon the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his companion admitted. &ldquo;Do you think
the route we have come over is feasible for the
army?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can be made so with less trouble than is possible
on the other road. But let us go into the
swamp a short distance; so far as I can see the way is
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t see very far,&rdquo; Ira replied. &ldquo;Two
rods away the road twists entirely out of sight. To
my mind, it is just the place where the Yankees
would be likely to put in their obstructions thick and
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can at least look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon at the turn, and found, just beyond,
was a huge pile of fallen trees. Over these they clambered
and continued on to the next bend, where was a
second collection of fallen timber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it is like this throughout the entire
swamp?&rdquo; the officer growled as he and his comrade
made their way with difficulty over the second pile of
hewn trees to the clear road beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; the young scout answered.</p>
<p>This surmise proved correct; over more than a
score of such stacks of timber they were forced to
crawl before arriving at the lower edge of the swamp.
By this time the sun had set, and with a shrug of his
shoulders the captain said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to go back over those barricades to-night.
Isn&rsquo;t there some place on this side where we
can find shelter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His guide was silent a moment as though thinking,
and then replied: &ldquo;Yes. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of continuing on the road as the officer had
expected, the lad struck into the woods on the left,
where the ground was still of a swampy nature. But,
leaping from log to log, he led the way with a rapidity
that made it difficult for the Britisher to keep pace
with him, and impossible to carry on any conversation.</p>
<p>After traveling for a few rods they lost sight of the
road, and then, instead of decaying logs, they found
trees which had been felled so that they lay end to
end, clearly to furnish a firm footing for any who
wished to go deeper into the forest. If the engineer
noted the singularity of this circumstance, he had no
chance to comment upon it, for Ira was still a rod
or more in the lead. At length, however, he stopped
and allowed the captain to come up with him. They
were then on the edge of a sluggish creek of considerable
width and depth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; the captain demanded.
&ldquo;What have you come here for, jumping from log to
log like a frog? We cannot ford this stream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; his guide replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go down a bit,&rdquo; and as he spoke the lad bent over,
searching with his hands until he found a rope.
Pulling on this, he drew out from under the overhanging
bushes, a small canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; he said, holding it steady for his companion
to embark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been here before,&rdquo; Captain Howells
remarked as he sat down in the light craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, or I should not have known the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stepped in, cast off the rope, and took up the
paddle, the young scout added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I wasn&rsquo;t sure of finding the boat here.
Some one else might have used it, or a freshet carried
it away. There was a risk in coming; but this
course will take us to the nearest house where we can
pass the night, so I concluded to run the chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was already paddling down the stream, which
soon turned sharply to the eastward, and a little
farther on plunged into a narrow gorge with a low,
hollow sound that could now be plainly heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are falls ahead,&rdquo; the engineer cried in some
alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but we shall not go over them. Look on
the right side, and you will see a log cabin at the foot
of the south cliff. We shall stop there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment he dexterously swung the canoe
into a little basin just below the hut, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing out, he steadied the craft while his comrade
leaped ashore. Securing the boat he led the way
into the building, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was built a few years ago by a half-crazy
old fellow who gained a livelihood by hunting and
fishing. Since he died it has been public property
for those who know of it. I have been here now and
then with others on &rsquo;coon hunts. We&rsquo;ll gather some
fir boughs for a bed, and it won&rsquo;t be a bad place in
which to pass the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From their knapsacks they carried they first
satisfied their hunger, and then collected the material
for beds. In doing this it was necessary to approach
near the place where the creek made its downward
plunge, and Ira said carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How easy it would be to dam the stream here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but if you did that it would flood the whole
swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deep?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on your dam. As the water
is now standing on the surface nearly everywhere,
you would get nearly a foot of water for each twelve
inches dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four feet here then, would give the same depth
through the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically, unless there is some other place
where the water can run off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are up in all these things,&rdquo; the young scout
continued with a laugh. &ldquo;I fancy you can tell to an
hour, how long it would take for the water to rise
until it overflowed the dam again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; the engineer confessed, &ldquo;since I
do not know the exact dimensions of the swamp.
But the stream is deep, and the land low. It would
fill fast, and in a few days be impassable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much stuff here with which to make
a dam,&rdquo; Ira said in a careless tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes there is,&rdquo; the captain insisted. &ldquo;Give
me a half-dozen men, and in a day I could build all
that would be needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how you would do it,&rdquo; Ira cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; retorted the officer, warming
up to his subject. &ldquo;Do you see this big tree? I&rsquo;d
cut that down so it would fall across the gorge. Then
I&rsquo;d go on the other side, and fell the big hemlock. It
could be done in such a way that it would interlock
with the other, and the two trunks, when trimmed,
would give you the timbers against which you could
place your barricade. That I would build of posts,
driving them side by side across the bed of the stream.
It won&rsquo;t take many, and after stuffing the cracks with
leaves and moss from the forest, I would pack in dirt
and stones from the hillside until it was water-tight.
I wish I never had a harder job than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrade shook his head. &ldquo;It is all in knowing
how,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;What would be easy for
you, would be hard for some one else.&rdquo; And then the
discussion was dropped for the time. But after
they were lying on their rude beds, Ira suddenly
raised his head to ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, captain, suppose the Yankees should
catch on to this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; the officer asked, quickly rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, building a dam across the creek here. It
would not only flood the swamp, but the road as well.
We couldn&rsquo;t get the army along until the waters
subsided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet your life we couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the engineer replied.
&ldquo;It is a great scheme; but then a Yankee would
never think of it,&rdquo; and he settled back on his bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Not so with his comrade. He appeared uneasy
about something, and sat up. Then he arose and
went to the door, fumbled with the bar that fastened
it, as though making it more secure; in reality to
remove it entirely. After this he went to the window
and looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; the officer asked sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get it out of my head about those Yankees
coming here to-night to build that dam,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;I was now looking out to see if we could
jump through the window if they should appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is all right. But how about getting up
the sides of the gorge. Can we do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after a fashion. It is better than taking to
the swamp in the night-time. I shall go that way, if
needs must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira now returned to his bed and lay down, but
tossed restlessly about, which uneasiness his companion
soon shared. At length they both dozed, but
only to be awakened within a short time by the sound
of voices on the river below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the hut! Be careful, and keep well in
to the bank, or we shall go down the falls!&rdquo; one voice
exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! there&rsquo;s another canoe. Some one else is
here!&rdquo; another cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! The red-coats may have a guard here,
and we will be able to capture them,&rdquo; a third said in
a lower tone.</p>
<p>Both sleepers were now awake; but Ira, for reasons
of his own, kept quiet, and breathed heavily. The
next instant the captain leaped to his feet, and came
noiselessly over to him. Shaking the lad vigorously,
he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Master Le Geyt! The Yankees have
come, and we must run for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young scout arose, and the officer, running to
the open window, jumped out, evidently expecting
his companion to follow, as he ran toward the hill.
At its foot he paused, and looked back. Several dark
forms were near the cabin, and in another instant the
door was burst open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; some one shouted, and then two
or three guns were discharged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>One of the bullets whistled dangerously near the
Britisher&rsquo;s head, and, believing he had been seen, he
clambered on as stealthily as possible. Gaining the
summit, he stopped again and listened. There were
shouts to be heard, and lights at the hut; but no sound
of any one following, and, concluding that his comrade
had been killed or captured, the engineer plunged on
down the other side of the ridge, disappearing in the
thicket at its base.</p>
<p>Could he have looked back, it would have been
possible to see Ira shaking hands heartily with the six
persons who came into the building, three of whom
were his own comrades, and the others no less loyal
to the Cause. Had he remained in hearing he would
have heard Dan Cushing&rsquo;s explanation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were at the lower edge of the swamp-road,
waitin&rsquo; for you, Ira, when we saw you comin&rsquo; along
with that British officer. We hid until you came up,
an&rsquo; heered him ask you &rsquo;bout a place to stay all night.
I caught your sign &rsquo;fore you took to the swamp, an&rsquo;
followed to the creek, findin&rsquo; the note you put in the
tree &rsquo;fore the captain jined ye. When that had been
read we knew what to do, an&rsquo; that red-coat has gone
over the ridge as if the devil was after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All laughed, and then Ira said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go. He has done us a good turn, for he
gave me some ideas about dam-building which we&rsquo;ll
make use of to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>They were at the task early in the morning, following
many of the suggestions of the British engineer.
One of the men who had accompanied the lads
had some practical knowledge of dam-building, however,
and neatly hewed two edges of the posts before
they were driven into place, thus securing joints that
were almost water-tight. Heavy moss from the forest,
and gravel brought in baskets from the hill-side, made
up the filling, and before the workers sought their
well-earned rest they knew that the water was rising.</p>
<p>The dam in the forest, which indirectly was to
hinder the advance of the British army for days, had
become an accomplished fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">THE SUSPICIOUS TORY.</span></h2>
<p>At dawn on the following morning one thing was
clear to every occupant of the old hut:	The water
was rising so rapidly that they would soon be compelled
to vacate the building. Therefore, after breakfast,
they looked about for a place in which to build a
new shanty. After considerable discussion it was decided
to put the structure on the heights across the
creek.</p>
<p>There were two reasons for such decision. If the
cabin was built there, it would be above the reach of
the rising waters; and a small party at that point
might protect the dam in case the British sent down
a force to destroy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that Captain Howell will ask General
Burgoyne to let him lead a company down here for
the double purpose of rescuing me and preventing
the building of a dam,&rdquo; Ira said laughingly. &ldquo;If so,
we better be prepared for it. With the river between
you and them, five on the hill could drive off any
force he is likely to bring with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven of us,&rdquo; Late said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; the lad admitted, &ldquo;but there will soon be
only five. When you have moved the stuff, I shall
set off for the encampment, taking Dan with me as
far as the swamp-road, for I count on sending him
to Fort Edward with a report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later the site for the new shelter had
been selected, and the goods carried over. Then Ira
and Dan embarked in one of the canoes, and paddled
off up the swelling stream. The water had risen so
high that the voyagers were able to push the light craft
through the forest to a place where young Cushing
could step directly out upon the highway. As he did
so, he gazed over the increasing waters and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us another twenty-four hours, Ira, an&rsquo; this
road will be covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so,&rdquo; the latter replied, &ldquo;and I think,
by picking my way, I can push up the swamp to the
north side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely can by goin&rsquo; back to the creek, an&rsquo;
runnin&rsquo; on that till it turns to the west. Hide your
boat somewhere up that way, an&rsquo; you can come down
to us any time you&rsquo;ve a mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very-well,&rdquo; Ira answered; &ldquo;but now for the
message to General Schuyler. Here is a rough drawing
of the road, the swamp, and the dam. I have
written no description, and it will mean nothing to
any one but you. Do you understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear as a bell,&rdquo; the lad admitted a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can explain it to the general. Tell him
why we built the dam, and what we hope to accomplish
by it. Give us two days more, and I see no
way for the red-coats to pass the swamp while the
dam holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout the size of it,&rdquo; Dan replied grimly,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; no one will see it quicker than the general.
&rsquo;Twas a lucky minute when it popped into your head,
Ira,&rdquo; and with this compliment he swung down the
roads towards the fort.</p>
<p>Ira watched until he was out of sight, and then
paddled leisurely back to the creek. Up this he went
to its westward bend, and, leaving it, glided through
the woods as long as he found any depth of water.
Then, picking up the light craft, he carried it to a
point where the land rose into something like a
hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;The water can&rsquo;t rise much farther than this,&rdquo;
he thought, glancing back over the route he had
followed.</p>
<p>Concealing his burden among the bushes, he strode
on towards the camp, arriving there a little before
noon, and going directly to the tent of the commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Le Geyt!&rdquo; exclaimed that officer as he
saw his visitor, &ldquo;I had decided you were in the rebels&rsquo;
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Captain Howell come back?&rdquo; the young
scout asked, eager to learn all he might about that
officer before telling the story of his prolonged absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the general replied; &ldquo;but he can explain
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night he crawled over the barricade on which
his corps was at work, and fell unconscious among
the men. They brought him into camp and called the
surgeon. He examined him, finding one leg broken.
Evidently he had crawled many miles in that condition,
and was nearly exhausted. When did you
part with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he not been able to tell you any thing?&rdquo;
asked the lad, giving no heed to General Burgoyne&rsquo;s
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has been in a delirium ever since, and we
can get nothing from him save fragments of a story.
He has spoken of the Yankees, your capture, and
his fall. We could only suppose that you two had
run against some of the rebels during the tramp; that
you had been captured, he got away, and was injured
during his flight. We shall have to depend on
your report to straighten matters out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much to tell,&rdquo; the lad replied. &ldquo;We
stopped in an abandoned hut for the night, and were
awakened by the sound of voices. He jumped from
the cabin window and got away; but half a dozen
rebels entered the building before I could escape. I
stayed there until this morning, when they let me
go, deciding, perhaps, that I was not worth keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were fortunate indeed. I presume, then,
you discovered no road around the rebel barricades?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ira replied. &ldquo;They increase rather than
diminish in number, and below here a few miles is
a huge swamp, which, for some reason, is flooding
rapidly. By the time we arrive there I believe it will
be well-nigh impassable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a way in which to fight!&rdquo; exclaimed the
officer in disgust. &ldquo;If they would only come out in
the open and give me a chance I would soon scatter
them like chaff before the wind. But here they are
blocking the way, exhausting my stores, forcing me
to change all my plans of campaign; it is enough to
make a saint angry!&rdquo; and by this time he had worked
himself into such a rage that the hearer was glad,
on the plea of being tired, to retire to his own
quarters.</p>
<p>When he next saw the general the latter was in a
better mood. He had sent for the scout, and when
Ira entered the tent he found there a young fellow,
scarcely older than himself, to whom the officer at
once introduced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Master Bowen,
a courier like yourself, which is a bond that ought to
make you fast friends. He has come from Quebec
bringing me good news. In a short time Colonel St.
Leger is to leave that city for Oswego. From there
he will march against Fort Stanwix,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> and, capturing
that, sweep down the valley of the Mohawk, driving
the rebels before him, until he joins me at Albany.
Now how large a force remains at Fort Stanwix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled as Ira was by these tidings, he nevertheless
replied calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last I knew, General Burgoyne, there were
two hundred men in the fort. Of course I can&rsquo;t tell
you whether any reinforcements have been sent there
within a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>It was the number that caught the general&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, Master Bowen?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Only two hundred men there, and how large a force
did you say St. Leger has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred regulars, and one thousand Indians,&rdquo;
the courier answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen hundred in all!&rdquo; the officer announced
with exultation. &ldquo;We shall hear great things from
him I do not doubt, and the rebels, being caught between
our two forces, must be crushed to powder.
Ha! ha!&rdquo; and he laughed loudly.</p>
<p>For some time he discussed the matter with his
young visitors, and then dismissed them. Ira took
Master Bowen, as a matter of courtesy, to his own
tent, where he bade him make himself at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to come and go on my regular
duties,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but you are welcome to all I
have so long as you remain with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be but a few hours,&rdquo; the courier replied.
&ldquo;The authorities in Quebec are eager to know what
progress our army is making, and as soon as the general
can prepare his report I shall start on my return.
I hope it may be some time to-night. I can then reach
the lake, where I have a sailboat, in time for the
morning breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reasons of his own Ira stuck close to his new
friend during the rest of the day, and when the hour
came for the latter to depart, asked permission of
the general to accompany him a mile or two on his
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; that officer replied. &ldquo;I said you
would be fast friends, and the fact that you are loath
to part with him proves it. Go as far as the lake, if
you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the lad replied, and he and the
courier left the lines together.</p>
<p>When they had traveled no more than two miles
on the trail Ira bade his acquaintance good-bye, and
turned back towards the camp. He did not enter it,
however. Passing to the eastward, he hurried through
the hills to the place where he had left his canoe the
day previous. Carrying the boat to the waters, which
had risen many inches since he was there, he embarked
and pulled with feverish haste down to the
dam. Landing, he climbed up to the new Shelter and,
arousing the inmates, astonished them by his sudden
appearance and startling news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Late and Joe,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You must
go down to the fort at once. I am sending both, for
it may be that General Schuyler will want you to
go on to Fort Stanwix. Tell him that a Colonel St.
Leger with seven hundred regular troops and one
thousand Indians will land at Oswego about August
first. His purpose is to capture the fort, and then to
sweep down the Mohawk valley to Albany, where he
hopes to join forces with Burgoyne. As I have said,
if he wants you to go to the fort with the tidings, do
so. I can get along for a while with one helper.
Should you meet Dan on his way back, let him return
to the fort with you, learn the general&rsquo;s plans,
and bring me word. I must know what is going on
entirely along our lines, if I am to do my work here
intelligently. Tell Dan I will be here the second
night from this to hear his report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the messengers were preparing for their
journey, he turned to the three men who, after helping
build the dam, had remained to help guard it,
saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Howell got back to the camp, but with
a broken leg and in a high fever. His condition is
such that he is not likely to take any interest in military
affairs for several days. Therefore the British
officers know nothing about the dam, and it is safe.
You may go back to your homes, if you so please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira waited until the five continentals had disappeared
down the south ridge. Then he closed the
cabin, went back to his canoe, and began his return
to the encampment.</p>
<p>Entering the enclosure from the same direction he
had departed a few hours previous, his absence created
no suspicion, and soon after midnight he was sleeping
soundly in his own bed.</p>
<p>During the following day the engineers succeeded
in removing the obstructions from the narrow pass,
and the entire army advanced among the hills to the
margin of the swamp. Here they were again stopped,
not only by great barricades, but by a flood over the
road-bed to the depth of at least three feet deep.
The uncertain footing either side the way, the many
turns in the road-bed, the numerous barricades, and
the depth of the water, all forced the impatient commander
to halt, while he sent forth men in every
direction to learn, if possible, the cause of the
flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>It created no surprise when Ira joined that company
which went to the north end of the great swamp,
and when they, wearied by a long tramp and fruitless
search, turned to retrace their steps, no one noted
that he lagged behind.</p>
<p>When night fell he was far enough in the rear to
make his way to the hidden canoe and paddle off
among the trees towards the creek. Once in this
watercourse, he made rapid progress, and soon was
in the cabin listening to Dan&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you &rsquo;bout my own trip.
After leavin&rsquo; you I struck out pretty smart for the
fort. Reachin&rsquo; it, I found the general away, so had
to wait till the next mornin&rsquo; &rsquo;fore I could see him.
He understood your plan at once, an&rsquo; was mighty
tickled with it. He told me to say that in two weeks
we could let the water off, an&rsquo; &rsquo;low the red-coats to
come on as fast as they might. He&rsquo;d be ready for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; Ira asked eagerly. &ldquo;Are
they strengthening the fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The general has chosen
Bemis Heights, &rsquo;cross the Hudson, as the place to get
in his work, and Kosciusko, that Polish officer, is
plannin&rsquo; the fortifications. It&rsquo;s there our troops will
fight it out with Burgoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Schuyler counts on abandoning Fort
Edward, then?&rdquo; Ira remarked musingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when the British get near enough to chase
him. He&rsquo;ll keep just out of their way till he&rsquo;s
enticed them &rsquo;cross the river. Then he&rsquo;ll wallop
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What forces has he now?&rdquo; was the next query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His own, an&rsquo; General St. Clair&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Dan replied,
keeping tally on his fingers. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s General
Benjamin Lincoln with the New England troops,
General Nicholas Herkimer an&rsquo; eight hundred militia,
Colonel Daniel Morgan with his rifle corps, and Colonel
Benedict Arnold with twelve hundred regulars,
more than ten thousand men in all. We&rsquo;ll whip the
red-coats yet, Ira.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; was the hearty rejoinder. &ldquo;Now
tell me what has been done about Fort Stanwix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on my way back,&rdquo; the lad explained,
&ldquo;when I met the boys an&rsquo; went to the fort with
them. The general was quite stirred up by the news;
but, noddin&rsquo; to me, said, &lsquo;Tell Ira there&rsquo;s time to
get plenty of reinforcements up there.&rsquo; Then,
turnin&rsquo; to Late and Joe, he went on, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have General
Herkimer an&rsquo; his troops on the way to-morrow,
an&rsquo; Colonel Arnold with his regulars shall follow.&rsquo;
He looked at me agin, an&rsquo; asked, &lsquo;Did you take that
in, Dan?&rsquo; An&rsquo; when I said, &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; he continued,
&lsquo;Put that in your report to Ira, too, an&rsquo; give him
my love,&rsquo; all of which I&rsquo;ve done accordin&rsquo; to
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Dan. No one could have done it better,&rdquo;
his companion replied almost gleefully. &ldquo;But
I must be off, or we&rsquo;ll have a troop of Britishers
looking me up. I&rsquo;ll drop in on you as often as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &rsquo;bout me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I can
stay here a week alone, if it means in the end some
good work for the Cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before arriving at the British encampment the
young scout met half a dozen soldiers who were looking
for him. The explanation that he had but just
got out of the swamp was deemed sufficient to account
for his delay, and the entire party went back
together.</p>
<p>Two weeks later a heavy thunder-storm raged. The
rain literally fell in torrents for hours. The first effect
was to swell the flood in the swamp; but on the following
day it subsided with great rapidity. In a
single day the road-bed could be seen above the water,
and General Burgoyne, with much delight, ordered
his corps of engineers to begin the work of clearing
away the obstructions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Ira at once surmised that the dam was gone, and
that night received the full particulars from Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First the rain swelled the creek,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
poured over the dam with a noise like thunder. Then
trees, uprooted by the wind, came down, and went
agin the timbers with a deafenin&rsquo; crash. They piled
up for a while, and then, all at once, the strain became
too great. The dam gave way, an&rsquo; water, trees
an&rsquo; timbers went down the gorge together. I took
the liberty to scurry off to the fort as soon as it happened,
an&rsquo; told the general. He said &rsquo;twas all right.
Let the army come &rsquo;long as fast as they could, he was
ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be some days before they reach there,&rdquo;
Ira said, curtly.</p>
<p>In this he was correct. It was more than a week
before the British army reached Fort Edward, and
then they found it, as they had the fort at Ticonderoga,
abandoned. General Schuyler, with all his
forces, stores, and guns, had crossed the Hudson to
Bemis Heights.</p>
<p>On the river bank that night Dan and Ira had a
brief interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here at last,&rdquo; Ira began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it took you twenty-four days to come
twenty-six miles,&rdquo; the other retorted drily. &ldquo;I
reckon it is the most remarkable journey on record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after General Burgoyne had established
his head-quarters in the abandoned fort, he
sent for his young scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is some one you will be glad to meet, Master
Le Geyt,&rdquo; was his greeting. &ldquo;A relative of yours,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira&rsquo;s face blanched as he turned to meet a man he
had never seen before. At a loss for words, he could
only gaze at the fellow, a tall, gaunt man of sixty
years or more, who promptly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be you Ira Le Geyt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of Hiram Le Geyt over on the Mohawk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the questioner gazed at him from
head to foot, and then blurted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE BEND OF THE WALLOOMSAC.</span></h2>
<p>Not a little startled by the words of the stranger,
Ira glanced at General Burgoyne to see what impression
they had made upon him. Seeing a look of
amusement, rather than suspicion, on the officer&rsquo;s face,
he grew bolder; but was still at loss what reply to
make, when he saw a piece of paper lying upon
a table in front of the general, on which a name was
written in an irregular, scrawling hand.</p>
<p>Instantly the lad recognized it as that of a zealous
Tory in an adjoining state, of whom he had heard
much. In a twinkling he understood that it was the
name of the man before him, who had sent it in to
the British commander when he sought an interview.</p>
<p>The glance, the reading, the conclusion, were as
a flash, and the next minute he was gazing smilingly
at the visitor, as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised that you don&rsquo;t know me, Uncle
Horace; but then, it is a long time since we met.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; the stranger exclaimed,
every line of doubt on his face changing to an expression
of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; the young scout replied confidently.
&ldquo;You are Horace Lyman of Bennington,
who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who married your ma&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; the Tory interrupted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer you look so different than you
did when over at my house, but, as you say, that is
some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been before father and I went to
Europe,&rdquo; Ira went on boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was, and a year over there must have
changed your looks, though I begin to see the old
face now. How is your pa and ma, and the younger
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well when I last heard from them,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;How is Aunt and Cousin Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt is poorly, very poorly,&rdquo; Master Lyman
answered. &ldquo;Sometimes I think she is a little
bit out here,&rdquo; and he touched his forehead, &ldquo;for she
persists that the rebels will in the end gain their
independence. But Fred, he&rsquo;s all right, physically
and mentally. He has done some good work in the
last week or two, about which I have been telling
the general, and now he wants to enlist in the king&rsquo;s
service. That is one reason why I am over here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I have promised to give the matter my consideration,&rdquo;
General Burgoyne remarked, as though
growing impatient with his visitors&rsquo; family affairs.
&ldquo;If you will take a turn about the fort for an hour
or two, Master Lyman, I will then tell you what I
can do in regard to both matters you have spoken
about,&rdquo; and he bowed him from the room.</p>
<p>Turning to Ira, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I give your relative a definite reply, I
must talk with you about the revelation he has made,
and the favor he desires. You have been in Bennington,
Master Le Geyt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, two or three years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where is located the inn known
as the &lsquo;State&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo; house? I mean its position
in the village, and its relation to the other public
buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It stands on the summit of the hill,
near the church,&rdquo; and the young scout rapidly described
the town, its surroundings, and its approaches,
wondering all the while what could be his commander&rsquo;s
reason for this information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;I learn through your uncle,&rdquo; the general said,
&ldquo;that the rebels are gathering large quantities of
ammunition and stores there. He believes I can make
an easy capture of them. Your cousin Fred, as you
call him, has been keeping watch over the doings in
the town and the neighborhood. Now in your judgment,
how large a force of men would be necessary
to make the raid on Bennington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be better for me to go back with
Uncle Horace, and look around?&rdquo; Ira suggested, hoping
to gain time in which to warn the people of the
danger that threatened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask that of you,&rdquo; the general
replied. &ldquo;According to your relative, the stores are
still being brought in, and it will be well for us to
defer our raid until they have finished the work.
But there is another part of Master Lyman&rsquo;s tale
which greatly interests me. He declares that there
is an opportunity for me to secure from the neighboring
farms, horses in sufficient numbers to equip a
regiment of cavalry. If this can be done, it would
give me a great advantage over the rebels. I would,
therefore, like to have you spend a few days in that
locality looking carefully into the matter. In such
task you may find occasion to employ your cousin,
and thus learn whether he can be of further value
to us as guide, courier, or staff officer. It is the
latter position your uncle desires for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;When does Uncle Horace intend to return
home?&rdquo; questioned the scout, still thinking how he
could serve his friends and save the stores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow. I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be ready to go with him,&rdquo; Ira said, rising
to take his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May fortune favor you,&rdquo; were the parting words
of the general.</p>
<p>Though the lad saw Master Lyman upon the walls
of the fort, he did not think it wise to seek another
interview with him. Something might arise in their
conversation to awaken the suspicions of the Tory
as to his identity. When in Bennington, some months
previous, he had, by the merest chance, learned of
the royalist, and that he had a son Fred, who was
as ardent a supporter of the king as the father.
This information had served him a good turn; but
while he really meant to accompany the man to
Bennington, he had no intention of putting himself
in a position where either husband, wife, or
son would be likely to discover he was not the real
Ira.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Leaving it, therefore, for General Burgoyne to explain
to the visitor the plans which had been decided
upon, the young scout went into his own tent to devise,
if possible, some way by which the purpose of the
British commander could be thwarted.</p>
<p>When night came he slipped out of the fort, and
went over to the place where he had arranged to meet
Dan Cushing. He found the boy in waiting, and after
a brief conversation with him, did what he had
not expected to do when he left the British camp. At
the risk of being seen by some sharp-eyed picket, or
more alert Indian, he, in company with Dan, crossed
the river and entered the Continental lines.</p>
<p>For an hour he and his comrade were closeted with
General Schuyler, and then the two lads came forth,
Ira to make his way back to his quarters in the fort,
and Dan to mount a horse when, after a long detour
to the south of Fort Edward, he was to ride toward
Bennington.</p>
<p>Not far from nine o&rsquo;clock the following day Master
Lyman and Ira Le Geyt left the fort, and, taking
the nearest route for Bennington, rode leisurely
along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will find Fred of great help to
you in this work,&rdquo; Master Lyman said, &ldquo;and a good
word from you will surely give him the place he
wants on the general&rsquo;s staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He prefers that to the position of scout or courier?&rdquo;
the latter questioned, more to keep up appearances
than for any other reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Tory replied emphatically. &ldquo;If he is
only a scout or courier he must wear his ordinary
dress, but if put on the general&rsquo;s staff, with the rank
of a lieutenant or captain, he would have the regular
uniform, and that is what Fred wants. Ever since
he was in Quebec last fall he has just been about
crazy to get on some regimentals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he might be of more service in ordinary
clothes,&rdquo; Ira said grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and run a bigger risk. The reason Fred
sticks for a place on the staff of the general is, that
there won&rsquo;t be as much danger, as in the regular
service. There&rsquo;ll be more honor and less fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known others to choose the humbler place because
it called for more dangerous work,&rdquo; the young
scout said in the same grim tone.</p>
<p>The Tory looked at him sharply. &ldquo;Do you question
Fred&rsquo;s courage?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;How can I, until I see it put to the test?&rdquo; was
the demure response. &ldquo;I was merely thinking of
the difference between Fred&rsquo;s view and mine. I am
a scout because it gives me an opportunity to render
a greater service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tory scowled, but made no reply, and soon the
conversation turned to other matters. At noon they
ate dinner with a friend of Master Lyman&rsquo;s, of whom
the latter declared: &ldquo;He is as true a servant of the
king&rsquo;s as I am,&rdquo; a fact of which Ira made mental
note for future use.</p>
<p>At nightfall they were within a few miles of their
destination, and by pushing on could have reached
it before a very late hour; but Master Lyman evidently
had another plan in mind. As they arrived
at a road leading northward, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile or so beyond is the home of James Earle.
I promised to stop on my way back from the fort
and tell him what I had seen and heard. We&rsquo;ll go
there for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for you to say,&rdquo; his comrade replied, turning
his horse to follow his leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>A tract of woodland could be seen just ahead, and
as if to pass through it as rapidly as possible, the
Tory spurred his horse to a canter. As he disappeared
beneath the shadow of the trees, Ira suddenly
reined in his own steed, and, turning toward the
road they had left, uttered the cry of a night hawk.
Almost immediately it was repeated at no great distance
in the rear, and, apparently satisfied, the lad
dashed away after his companion.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the two had arrived at Master
Earle&rsquo;s house, where they were warmly received, and
provided with a hearty supper. When the meal had
been eaten, the travelers and their host went into the
front room of the house, leaving the women to clear
away the table. Soon the two Tories were busily
engaged discussing the situation and condition of the
British army, and its prospects of success. Both
were confident that in a few days they would hear of
the overwhelming defeat of the Continentals.</p>
<p>Ira, left to himself, sauntered across the room to an
open window, and looked out. The night, although
there was no moon, was not very dark, and his sharp
eyes detected a party of horsemen, just leaving the forest
below the house, and coming rapidly up. He did
not seem to be alarmed, however, at his discovery,
and waited for the sound of the horses&rsquo; hoofs to
reach the ears of the men behind him. But they were
so engrossed in conversation as to hear nothing until
the approaching riders were almost opposite the
dwelling. Then, springing to their feet in alarm,
both cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if arousing from a revery, Ira exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, Master Earle, you have more visitors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer was at his side in an instant, and, with
a glance at the coming troopers, turned and ran toward
the kitchen, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Master Lyman! They are rebels, and
we must hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he and his friend gained the back door too
late to escape. The lad followed in time to see both
fall into the hands of four stalwart men, who were
lying in wait. Two others seized the young scout
as he appeared, and then the commander of the company,
a long, lank, grizzly-bearded man, not far
from the age of the Tories, came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Sam Adams?&rdquo; Master
Earle demanded. &ldquo;It is an outrage to treat men this
way in a free country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t free yet,&rdquo; the lieutenant retorted, &ldquo;that
is, we ain&rsquo;t free of red-coats or Tories, though we
are likely to be before a great while. Howsomever,
if you want to know by whose authority I have arrested
you and Squire Lyman, I&rsquo;ll say the Committee
of Safety sent me for that purpose, and they&rsquo;ll tell
you what&rsquo;s wanted. But who&rsquo;s that young chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my nephew, Ira Le Geyt,&rdquo; Master Lyman
replied quickly. &ldquo;He was going home with me for
a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira Le Geyt,&rdquo; repeated the officer slowly.
&ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard that name before, though
I can&rsquo;t tell where. But I&rsquo;ve no orders to take him.
Let the lad go, men, and we&rsquo;ll hope the next time we
see him he will be in better company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave orders to bring horses from the barn
for his prisoners, and shortly the entire party rode
away.</p>
<p>Ira, left alone with the women, tried to soothe them
by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Burgoyne will send an army down here
as soon as he hears of this, and tired as I am, I will
be off at once if I can have a fresh horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small boy went to the barn with the scout, showing
him which animal to take, and within fifteen
minutes after the horsemen had departed, Ira was following
them toward the main road. Arriving there,
he found Dan Cushing in waiting, and, after heartily
greeting each other, both started for the village, Dan
saying as they rode along:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I left you last night, Ira, I pushed straight
on to Bennington, arriving at Captain Park&rsquo;s house
before he was up; but he wasn&rsquo;t slow after readin&rsquo; General
Schuyler&rsquo;s letter. First he gave me a fine breakfast,
after which he said I was to go to bed an&rsquo; get
some sleep. Then he hurried off to consult with the
town committee. They must have hustled, for when I
awakened a little after noon, the captain told me there
were already four companies of militia in the village,
guarding the stores, an&rsquo; that a messenger had been
sent off to Derryfield, New Hampshire, after Colonel
John Stark to take command of the troops, which are
expected to number two thousand by to-morrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean business, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; his comrade
interrupted; &ldquo;but go on, Dan, with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest is soon told. Captain Park sent me
down the road to be on the lookout for you an&rsquo; the
Tory. He thought the old feller would stop at Master
Earle&rsquo;s, because the two are great cronies. I got to
the cross-roads an hour &rsquo;fore you did, put a red rag on
the bush so you&rsquo;d know I was &rsquo;round, an&rsquo; then hid in
the woods. I heerd an&rsquo; answered your signal, then
went back to town for the troopers. There&rsquo;s only one
thing more to tell you. The Safety Committee want
to see you when we get into town. They&rsquo;ve got something
to talk over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; Ira replied. &ldquo;Where am I to find
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the captain&rsquo;s, where we&rsquo;re to stop. They
thought you would be tired, an&rsquo; so agreed to be right
there when you arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than an hour the two lads were at their destination,
and when a servant had taken their horses,
both entered the huge kitchen of the mansion to find
themselves face to face with twelve men, whose resolute
countenances said more plainly than words that
they were not to be trifled with when the enterprise
they were engaged in was a righteous one. The men
were seated around a long table, and Dan, stepping in
advance of his comrade, announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Governor Wentworth, this is the feller &rsquo;bout
whom General Schuyler wrote, an&rsquo; who is now known
as Ira Le Geyt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The twelve committeemen turned their eyes upon
the newcomer, and he on his part gazed earnestly at
them. Several he knew by sight, though he had no
personal acquaintance with them; the others were
strangers, save him at the foot of the table. As Ira&rsquo;s
glance fell on this man he recognized him as a citizen
whom he had met when on a former visit to the town,
and he understood by the look given him, that the
recognition was mutual. A slight shake of the head,
however, gave this patriot to understand that the lad
did not wish to be known, and then Ira listened to
the governor, who now said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though unknown to us, young man, we cannot
doubt your faithfulness to the Cause we represent.
The endorsement of General Schuyler alone is sufficient
for us, and when to that is added the service
you have already rendered, I, speaking for the others,
may say that besides our welcome, you have our
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not unknown to me,&rdquo; broke in the committeeman
at the other end of the table. &ldquo;Although
not at liberty to declare his name, I can vouch for his
patriotism. No one of us loves the Cause more than
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever yet doubted your word, Master
Whipple,&rdquo; the chairman replied, &ldquo;and we shall not
do so now. Still, does not the work this young man
has voluntarily taken upon himself tell, as no other
words can, of love for country?&rdquo; and he looked
around upon his companions in a way which told he
believed the matter of the young scout&rsquo;s standing was
settled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>As no one contradicted him, he turned again to Ira,
asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do for us, my young sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the matter of the coming raid?&rdquo; the lad
questioned. &ldquo;I cannot prevent it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not have you do that,&rdquo; was the quick
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; the boy went on; &ldquo;but I think I can
control the time of that raid, and the size of the raiding
force. At least, I am to report to General Burgoyne
on those two points, and have reason to believe
my words will have weight with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long can you wait before making that
report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-eight hours will answer our purpose,&rdquo;
the governor declared. &ldquo;Within that time we expect
Colonel Stark will be here, and prefer to have
him look over the field to decide on a plan of defense
before your report is carried to the British commander.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the colonel personally, and would say you
cannot have a more brave leader,&rdquo; Ira replied. &ldquo;I
shall be glad to take to the general any report the
colonel may suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We congratulate ourselves that we have the outcome
of this raid within our own hands,&rdquo; the chairman
added, &ldquo;and we promise that you shall carry back
an accurate list of the stores held by us, as well as of
the cattle and horses we have collected. General Burgoyne
will have no reason to suppose that you have
been otherwise than busy during the time you have
been away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be good bait,&rdquo; one of the company remarked
laughingly as the meeting broke up.</p>
<p>The young scout went over to Master Whipple.
&ldquo;May I ask a favor of you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the hearty reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, then, see Colonel Stark before I meet
him, and ask that he know me now only as Ira Le
Geyt? Should my own name reach the ear of any
Tory, no matter who he may be, my usefulness in the
British camp would be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your life would be in danger,&rdquo; suggested his
hearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a small matter,&rdquo; was the calm reply;
&ldquo;but we cannot just now afford to lose the advantage
which comes by having a friend amid the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think not,&rdquo; Master Whipple said emphatically,
&ldquo;and if you are willing to stay there, we
should use every precaution to keep your secret. I
will see the colonel as you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Ira was on the street with Captain
Park, when his attention was called to a lad not
far from his own age, who was loitering around the
building in which the arms and ammunition of the
Continentals were stored. There was something in
his appearance that seemed familiar, and after looking
at the fellow a few seconds, it suddenly flashed
upon the young scout that he was Fred Lyman. It
was the resemblance to his father that had made the
lad&rsquo;s face seem familiar. To make sure that his surmise
was correct, he asked the officer by his side, the
name of the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Lyman,&rdquo; was the prompt answer. &ldquo;His
father and Master Earle are confined in one of the
rooms of the store-house, and doubtless he is hanging
around there hoping to get into communication with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure but it would be wise to put him
into the room with them,&rdquo; said the young scout as he
eyed the fellow again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has never shown any qualities that has made
us consider him dangerous,&rdquo; was the laughing reply
of the officer, and they passed on.</p>
<p>That night, to the surprise of every one, Colonel
Stark arrived in town. His early arrival was explained
by his own words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes after your message was brought to
me, I was on my way here. Call your committee
together. The sooner we come to an understanding
about matters the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of that secret session was to give the
experienced officer absolute control of the defense of
the town. The next day he looked over the village
and its immediate surroundings, and then sent for
Ira.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Ira Le Geyt?&rdquo; was his greeting,
with special emphasis on the name. &ldquo;How is&mdash;well,
my friend General Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter with him, or me,
colonel,&rdquo; was the lad&rsquo;s laughing reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he was as sure of whipping Burgoyne, as
I am of the force the Britisher may send down here.
But now to business. Come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>He led the way to the Heights, where was a bend in
the Walloomsac river, and into which, on the left,
a smaller stream entered. Calling the attention of
his companion to these features, the officer asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose you can induce the red-coats to
make an encampment here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me understand you perfectly, colonel, and I
will make every effort to put the British forces where
you want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advise General Burgoyne to send a thousand
men,&rdquo; the officer explained. &ldquo;Before they get here
I&rsquo;ll have my skirmishers hanging around them, and,
finding he is going to meet with opposition, the commander
will naturally look for some place in which to
entrench himself. Show him this spot, and let him
make his stand here. That is your part; I&rsquo;ll take
care of the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, if it lies within my power,&rdquo; the
young scout promised.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, with a complete list of the Continental
stores, and a rough outline of the village and
the surrounding hills in his pocket, Ira, accompanied
by Dan Cushing, rode toward Fort Edward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">CLIPPING THE LEFT WING.</span></h2>
<p>When the lads arrived at the cross-road leading to
Master Earle&rsquo;s, Ira gave his horse to Dan, and sent
him to the farm to exchange the animal for the one he
had left there.</p>
<p>Dan appeared so dull, and knew so little about
affairs in Fort Edward, whence they supposed he
had come, that the inmates of the house at length
decided he was some half-witted fellow who knew
enough to bring their horse home, and but little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better follow him down to the main road,
and make sure he turns the right way,&rdquo; Mistress
Earle said to her eldest son, a boy of a dozen years.
Therefore he, unnoticed by Dan, came down the road,
and was near enough, when the latter joined his
comrade, to recognize Ira.</p>
<p>Surprised at seeing the young scout there, the boy
stood staring after the horsemen until they had disappeared
from view down the Fort Edward road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Then he turned toward his home to make known
the wonderful discovery; but getting a glimpse of a
horseman coming from the direction of Bennington,
he waited that he might see who he was. The surprise
he had felt on seeing Ira Le Geyt, was deepened
upon beholding in the third rider none other than his
friend Fred Lyman. When he was within hearing,
he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Fred! Your cousin, Ira Le Geyt, is just
ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; young Lyman asked, reining in
his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say your cousin, Ira Le Geyt, has just gone
down the road. Don&rsquo;t you remember that ma told
your folks about him when she let you know my pa
and your pa had been captured by the rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but she said he had gone back to the fort to
get help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what she thought&mdash;what I thought until
just now,&rdquo; the boy explained, and he quickly told of
his discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; the young Tory said in a
puzzled tone. &ldquo;It looks as if he had been in Bennington
ever since night before last, and if that&rsquo;s so,
I don&rsquo;t see why he didn&rsquo;t come out to our house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Discuss the matter as the boys would, neither
could explain the mystery, and finally Fred said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll overtake him and find out,&rdquo; and, whipping up
his horse, he trotted rapidly down the road in the
trail of the two scouts.</p>
<p>They must also have ridden fast, for it was not
until the two were breaking their fast beside a wayside
spring, that young Lyman came up with them.</p>
<p>He was clattering down a small hill when he first
caught sight of them, and would have been glad to
stop and reconnoiter a little, for he recognized them
as the two lads he had seen at Bennington, in company
with the rebels. But his horse had seen the
other animals, and with a loud whinny dashed on
toward them.</p>
<p>The young scouts heard the noise of the horse&rsquo;s
hoofs before he came into view, and were on their
feet, rifles in hand, ready for any emergency the moment
he appeared. Recognizing the rider, Ira exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Fred Lyman! What can he be doing
here? We must stop him and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
trying to hold up his beast. Perhaps he has been
trying to overhaul us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>In another moment the young Tory drew up
within a few feet of the lads, eyeing them somewhat
suspiciously. They, on their part, looked sharply in
return, but waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! are you Ira Le Geyt?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what they call me,&rdquo; the young scout
replied pleasantly, &ldquo;and you are my cousin, Fred
Lyman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer leaped to the ground and gazed at
the speaker earnestly before he spoke, and then it was
to use almost precisely the same words his father had
a few days previous in the British camp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you look like cousin Fred,&rdquo; Ira replied,
&ldquo;though you may have grown a little since I last
saw you,&rdquo; (and he added under his breath, &ldquo;but
it is mighty little, for I saw you only yesterday&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have grown lots since you visited us,&rdquo; young
Lyman declared with evident pride, &ldquo;but see here,
Ira, where have you been all the time since the rebels
captured father?&rdquo; and there was an angry tone in his
voice.</p>
<p>But the young scout was not to be caught in that
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;In Bennington,&rdquo; he replied truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw you there hob-nobbing with the
rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must sometimes appear friendly with the
enemy, if he wants to learn all he can about them,&rdquo;
the lad answered meaningly. &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; and he
drew from his coat the list of the Bennington stores
and his rude map of the village, handing them without
hesitation to the young Tory, as he added,
&ldquo;Does that look as if I had been idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Fred admitted with some reluctance; &ldquo;but
why didn&rsquo;t you go back to the fort after the soldiers?
You might have had them here by this time, and
rescued pa and Master Earle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my orders were to obtain all the information
about the goods and the town, that I could, and
I am in the habit of obeying General Burgoyne&rsquo;s
commands,&rdquo; was the reply, with a slight emphasis
on the last three words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might have come to the house and seen
us, so&rsquo;s to explain what you were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When with the enemy it is sometimes wisest to
ignore your best friends,&rdquo; Ira retorted, stating another
general truth, and leaving it for his hearer to
make the application.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Lyman was for the time silenced, and the young
scout in his turn became questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that you are here, Fred?&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;On your way to the fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I, too, have important news for General Burgoyne,&rdquo;
he replied with a show of pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened since I came away?&rdquo; was
the next query, and in a tone which implied, &ldquo;not a
great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stung by the tone rather than the words, the young
Tory replied sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think you know everything, Ira Le
Geyt. I learned this morning that Colonel John
Stark has arrived and is to take charge of the Yankee
forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came last night, and I had a long talk with
him this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be two thousand militia in the village
before night, and the general ought to know that,&rdquo;
young Lyman added, but not quite so confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand, two hundred and fifty,&rdquo; Ira
added quietly. &ldquo;Anything else, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he at length drawled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly necessary for you to take a long ride
down to the fort for that news, seeing that I have
gathered it already,&rdquo; the young scout said curtly.
&ldquo;Have dinner with us, and then you may go back
home. I promise that by day after to-morrow, if not
before, General Burgoyne will have an army in Bennington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wanted to see the general,&rdquo; Fred confessed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask him if he will give me a
place on his staff. Do you know anything about that,
cousin Ira?&rdquo; and there was an eagerness in his
voice which showed how much he coveted the position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Horace spoke of it,&rdquo; Ira replied, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I advise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the listener asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home now, and when the king&rsquo;s soldiers march
out of Bennington loaded with plunder, follow them.
Put in a claim that you were the one who first discovered
that the rebels were gathering stores. Your
father will swear to it, I&rsquo;ll back him up, and the general
will be so good-natured, because of the victory,
that he&rsquo;ll give you anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A captain&rsquo;s commission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a major&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll ask for a colonel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the young
Tory declared. &ldquo;What I have done is worth it,&rdquo; and
he fastened his horse to a tree, after which he went
toward the food.</p>
<p>Ira introduced Dan, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my right hand in the special work I am
doing,&rdquo; and then all chatted merrily together as they
ate.</p>
<p>An hour later Fred shook hands with his companions,
and started back to town. As he rode over
the brink of the hill, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts glanced at each other, and Ira remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got rid of him more readily than I expected.
He might have made us much trouble had he gone
on to the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be dreamin&rsquo; of that colonel&rsquo;s commission,&rdquo;
Dan added laughingly.</p>
<p>They resumed their journey, and after a time, Ira
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred&rsquo;s coming has given me an idea, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that it&rsquo;s a good one,&rdquo; was the confident
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;That you go with me into the fort as Fred
Lyman, and stay there while I go back to Bennington
with the British forces. Somehow I can&rsquo;t get over the
idea that we shall need a friend to the Cause there
while I&rsquo;m gone. Something might happen, you know,
that should be reported to General Schuyler immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say that&rsquo;s the thing to do, I&rsquo;m ready.
You&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;ll make a good cousin,&rdquo; and he laughed
to himself as though the idea was a pleasing
one.</p>
<p>They fell to discussing the details of this new plan
while riding slowly along, for now they did not care
to reach the vicinity of the fort until after nightfall.
A mile or two further on Ira rode into the woods,
where he waited until Dan had made a long detour and
crossed the river to General Schuyler&rsquo;s headquarters
to acquaint him with what was transpiring in Bennington,
as well as to tell him of the arrangements
made for the former, under the name of Fred Lyman,
to enter the British lines.</p>
<p>He was so long delayed that Ira had grown impatient,
and on his appearing cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would never come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay it all to the general,&rdquo; the lad replied. &ldquo;He
hated to let me go into the fort wuss than pizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Ira asked, as he remounted
his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;twas bad &rsquo;nough to have you thar without
riskin&rsquo; another life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I entered the service to risk my life, an&rsquo; I
might as well do it thar, as anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he let you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Not till I had said, &lsquo;Let us s&rsquo;pose a case,
general. S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; the first Britishers sent to Bennington
get whipped, as they will, an&rsquo; the commander
sends back for reinforcements. How be you goin&rsquo;
to know it in time to send a force to wallop them?
Howsomever, if I&rsquo;m thar in the fort, you&rsquo;ll get the
news mighty soon, an&rsquo; can &rsquo;range to beat the red-coats
out the second time. I reckon that is what Ira is
providin&rsquo; for, though he hasn&rsquo;t said so.&rsquo; Then he
shook his head, sayin&rsquo; kinder proudly, I thought,
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t fool that boy a great deal. Go ahead,
Dan,&rsquo; an&rsquo; ahead I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira laughed softly to himself as they galloped on
to the fort. Arriving, they were allowed to enter,
and, late though it was, sought General Burgoyne at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin, Fred Lyman, general,&rdquo; the young
scout said, presenting his companion.</p>
<p>The officer looked at the boy searchingly, and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like your looks, Master Lyman. I believe you
want a place on my staff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; the lad began slowly, &ldquo;but now that I&rsquo;ve
been workin&rsquo; with Ira, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like a job
suthin&rsquo; like his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general laughed. &ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;Train him, Master Le Geyt, so he can
take your place when you are away. He will have the
same pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave his undivided attention to the papers
the young scout had spread out. The list of goods
greatly interested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a haul will mean everything to us,&rdquo; he muttered,
and then turned to the plan of the village.
After a moment he called an orderly, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Colonel Baum to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Hessian arrived Ira explained the drawing
to him, and for some time the two officers discussed
the paper in German. At length General Burgoyne
remarked in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand the situation, colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; he replied in the same language.
&ldquo;With this young man to guide me, I see no reason
why I may not make a successful raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you start?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many men had he better take?&rdquo; the commander
asked of the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rebels will make some pretense of a defense,&rdquo;
Ira replied carelessly. &ldquo;I would take enough to give
them a good drubbing. Say one thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A larger force than I had supposed necessary,&rdquo;
General Burgoyne added musingly. &ldquo;Still, as you
say, Master Le Geyt, we better have enough to teach
the Yankees a lesson.&rdquo; Then to his subordinate he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the two companies of Loyalists, Colonel
Baum, who have asked permission to go on this raid.
You could take them, and five hundred of your own
men, making up the thousand with a squad of Indians.
They would be useful in scouring the surrounding
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say, general,&rdquo; the colonel
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are your orders,&rdquo; continued Burgoyne.
&ldquo;Seize those supplies; scour the country; test the
disposition of the people; levy contributions on the
towns, and last, though not least, bring back with you
twelve or thirteen hundred horses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>His subordinate repeated the orders, and then hurried
away to get his troops ready for their long march
by sunrise.</p>
<p>To the waiting scouts the general said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your own quarters for a few hours&rsquo; rest.
But you, Master Le Geyt, will hold yourself ready
to guide Colonel Baum and his forces to Bennington
to-morrow. Master Lyman, you will remain here to
guide a second force to the same town should such a
movement be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dawn the two lads stood side by side, watching
the soldiers as they marched out of the gates. First
went the trained Hessians, moving as perfectly as a
piece of machinery; then came the Tories, trying to
imitate the regulars in their military precision, but
making poor work of it; finally came the Indians,
straggling and sullen because they had been placed
in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel should reverse the order of march,&rdquo;
Ira said in a low tone to Dan, as he noted the scowling
faces of the savages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the only mistake he&rsquo;ll fall into &rsquo;fore he
gets back,&rdquo; was his comrade&rsquo;s reply. Then he asked,
&ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thirteenth of August,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But
why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;The thirteenth,&rdquo; Dan repeated. &ldquo;I thought so;
it means bad luck for the expedition,&rdquo; and he looked
straight into the face of his companion.</p>
<p>Both smiled, and as Colonel Baum and his staff
now came riding by, Ira mounted his own horse and
joined them.</p>
<p>For a distance of ten or twelve miles the army advanced
quietly; then they came upon a party of
skirmishers, who, after some sharp firing on both
sides, retreated toward the town. A mile farther on
the advance guard, while passing through a wooded
country, ran into a small ambuscade, from which was
poured a deadly fire. These Yankees were soon
driven back; but not until a score or more officers and
men had been killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea the rebels would be so bold,&rdquo;
Colonel Baum said to Ira. &ldquo;If this keeps on we
shall be disabled before gaining the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not send the Indians on ahead,&rdquo; the scout
suggested. &ldquo;They ought to be able to smoke out the
Yankees, and drive them from their holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; the officer replied, and ordered the
savages to the front, a position they were now reluctant
to take, for it began to appear as if the enemy
would make a stout fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The only result was to change as targets the Hessians
to the Indians, and so many of the redskins were
shot down that the entire company became demoralized,
falling back upon the rear troops.</p>
<p>Disheartened by these unexpected circumstances
Colonel Baum sought out a safe halting-ground for
the night, and sent back for reinforcements. Ira
offered himself as the messenger, but received the
reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I need you here. You know the ground
before us, and to-morrow I must have you select some
place where I can entrench, and wait for troops from
the fort to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day the skirmishers were no less vigilant,
and it was under a harassing fire that the Hessian
commander pushed forward past Mount Anthony,
to the bend in the Walloomsac river, where, at
the suggestion of his guide, he went into camp.</p>
<p>Before nightfall he had thrown up light entrenchments,
and for the first time within twenty-four
hours rested in fancied security, believing he could
hold out any length of time against an enemy which
he was now convinced outnumbered him two to one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>During the night a score or more Tories from the
neighborhood joined his force, among them, to Ira&rsquo;s
surprise, Master Earle, Horace Lyman, and his son
Fred. All were hearty in their greetings, and the
young scout, taking the young Tory into his own tent,
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Uncle Horace and Master Earle escape
from the Yankees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were set free,&rdquo; Fred replied. &ldquo;Father
thinks it was because they had no spare men for
guards. The rebels are so afraid of being whipped
by the king&rsquo;s troops that they are turning out to the
last man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; Ira replied curtly.</p>
<p>When the sun rose on the morning of the fifteenth,
it disclosed the Continental forces gathered on the
opposite bank of the river and along the road to
Bennington. Believing an attack near at hand, Colonel
Baum arranged his forces in three lines, the
Indians first, behind them the Tories, and his own
troops in the rear. With the first skirmishing the
redskins, unaccustomed to fighting pitched battles,
began to slip away. Alarmed by this fact, the commander,
knowing his young scout was familiar with
the savage tongue, sent him off to stay, if possible,
the flight of the fugitives, and, if unsuccessful in that,
to go down the road toward the fort and hasten the
coming of reinforcements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>This enabled Ira to refrain from fighting against
his friends. He was an interested spectator, however,
of what took place on that day and the next.</p>
<p>Content with an occasional skirmish, Colonel Stark
allowed the first day to pass without decisive action,
in the hope that another regiment of militia, which
was hourly expected, might arrive. But early on
the morning of the sixteenth he decided to wait no
longer. Calling his men together he addressed them
in words which have since become memorable:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the red-coats. We must beat them to-day,
or to-night my wife sleeps a widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sent detachments on both flanks to gain,
if possible, the British rear. He led the front attack
himself, and after two hours broke the line of the few
remaining Indians, who fled, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are full of Yankees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The center of the attack now fell upon the Tories,
who were driven back upon the Hessians, and the
entire British force, yielding slowly, was at length
pushed across the stream on their left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Colonel Baum now attempted to retrieve himself
by heading a new attack in person, but with no better
success. He was mortally wounded, his troops
routed, and his artillery captured.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a reinforcement of five hundred Hessians,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Breyman, was coming
to his aid. The messenger, asking for help, had
reached the fort promptly, but for some reason the
second force of regulars was not started for Bennington
until the following morning, and Dan Cushing
had ample time to get word to General Schuyler
of the new movement. Therefore when Colonel Breyman
left Fort Edward, Colonel Seth Warner, with
a force of fresh militia, was close at his heels.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Baum the Continentals broke
ranks in order to plunder. The watchful Ira succeeded
in getting word to Colonel Stark that British
reinforcements were to be expected at any minute.
In vain that officer tried to rally his men, and Colonel
Breyman, finding the Continentals unprepared for
a second fight, would have made short work of them
but for the arrival of Colonel Warner and his men.</p>
<p>The battle that now followed lasted until sunset,
when the enemy fell back, and were pursued by the
victorious Continentals until dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It was a straggling force of less than one hundred
that finally reached Fort Edward, for the British loss
numbered nine hundred and thirty-four, including
one hundred and fifty-seven Tories. The guns, ammunition
wagons, tents, baggage, and one thousand
stand of small arms belonging to the red-coats, were
left in the hands of the victors.</p>
<p>The next morning Ira and Dan walked over the
scene of the conflict. In a thicket across the little
brook they found the body of Fred Lyman. Apparently
he had been in hiding when struck in the back
by a stray bullet. Farther down the Heights were the
bodies of Horace Lyman and James Earle. Both
had been slain during the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no need for you to go back to the
fort with me,&rdquo; Ira said a little later to his comrade.
&ldquo;The young Tory is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dan Cushing is very much alive,&rdquo; that lad
retorted, &ldquo;and is ready to take your report to General
Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give it in a sentence,&rdquo; his companion said.
&ldquo;Tell him Burgoyne&rsquo;s left wing has been clipped at
Bennington.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE NIGHT ON THE ROAD.</span></h2>
<p>We will now follow Latham Wentworth and Joseph
Fisher in their long journey to Fort Stanwix.
When they left General Schuyler they found the
quarterly-sergeant, and went with him to secure the
supplies which would be needed. This sergeant,
named Wilson, was a talkative fellow, and as he aided
them in making up their packs, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any one told you about the latest act of the
Continental Congress, lads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Receiving a negative reply, he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only got the word a few days ago. It
seems that on June 14th Congress passed this act, I
saw a copy and remember every word: &lsquo;Resolved,
that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be
thirteen stars white on a blue field, representing a
new constellation.&rsquo; So we have a national banner
at last, and I hope, before the next fight with the red-coats,
that we&rsquo;ll have them floating above all our fortifications.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how it would look?&rdquo; Late asked of himself,
half-closing one eye, and gazing in the air as if
viewing the flag from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; the sergeant declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo;
and he drew from his coat-pocket a piece of paper.
Unfolding it he showed the boys a miniature flag,
drawn in its proper colors. There were seven red and
six white stripes, and the stars on the union were
arranged in a circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she a beauty? I
drew this myself, and at the first chance I&rsquo;m going
to show it to the general, in the hope that he&rsquo;ll let
me make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get ahead of you by making one for Fort
Stanwix,&rdquo; Joe remarked sportively, never dreaming
that his words would come true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The boys were ready for their long tramp, and,
bidding Master Wilson good-day, they left the fort,
turning their faces westward. Gaining the Hudson
river, at that point where the Mohawk flows into it,
they crossed over to the northern bank, and plunged
into the great forest, intending to avoid the settlements
as much as possible, lest their hurried trip
to the fort awaken needless alarm throughout the
valley.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the scouts disappeared amid the foliage
when an old man, of gigantic size, with hair
that fell upon his shoulders and a beard that came
nearly to his knees, arose from a thicket on the easterly
side of the river, and, wading across, plunged into
the forest on the trail of the boys. Like them, he
was armed with a rifle and knife, and carried a pack
upon his back. He muttered to himself while striding
vigorously along:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch you yet, you young devils! I&rsquo;ll catch
you yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His rapid gait told of a strength quite unusual for
one of his years, and it was clear he would prove no
mean antagonist for the lads whom he was following.</p>
<p>The scouts started late in the day, and by the time
they had traveled ten miles the shades of night were
falling fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go into camp,&rdquo; Late suggested.</p>
<p>His comrade agreed to this, and selecting a cleared
space beside a small stream, they erected a shelter of
bark and brush, made a bed of fir boughs, and sat
down to eat their supper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Owing to this labor, and the noise they had made
while at work, neither of the boys heard the sound
of footsteps, nor did they suspect that a man stood
behind a huge tree a few rods away, watching and
listening while they ate and talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we better keep guard to-night, Late?&rdquo;
Joe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly worth while,&rdquo; the former replied. &ldquo;I
sleep light, you know, an&rsquo; any noise out of the ordinary
will waken me. We ain&rsquo;t far enough away
from the fort yet for Indians or red-coats to bother
us, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have all the watchin&rsquo; we need when
farther up country, so I guess we&rsquo;d better turn in tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have come at least ten miles,&rdquo; Joe
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have ten times as many before us yet.
Can we do it in four days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make it in three,&rdquo; Late declared.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get to the fort any too soon, an&rsquo; my long
legs are good for the thirty-odd miles a day. How
is it with yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;ll hold out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start early, make brief stops, an&rsquo; travel
late, if need be; but we must deliver the message to
Captain Swartwout by Saturday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the listener behind the big tree
leaned out sufficiently from his place of concealment
to shake his fist at the boys, after which, as he shrank
back into the gloom again, he muttered to himself:
&ldquo;Perhaps you will, youngsters; but not if David
Daggett can prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still stood there when the lads stretched themselves
out upon the fir boughs, and fell asleep. Then,
smiling grimly, he slipped the pack from his back,
sat upon it with his back against the tree, and waited.</p>
<p>An hour passed; the heavy breathing of the occupants
of the shack told the old man that the young
scouts were sleeping soundly. He arose cautiously,
leaned his rifle against the pine, drew the hunting
knife from his belt, and, gripping it between his
teeth, slowly crept on all fours toward the camp.</p>
<p>Gaining it, he paused and listened. A loud snoring
told him that the lads were unconscious. Again he
smiled, and creeping noiselessly to the open end of the
rude shelter, he gazed at the sleepers. They lay
with their feet toward him; and far enough apart for
him to crawl between them, a feat he accomplished so
stealthily that they were not disturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Then, rising to his knees, he took the knife from his
teeth with his left hand, clutched the handle firmly
with his right, and raised it aloft, intending to plunge
it rapidly into first one and then into the other.</p>
<p>But before the weapon could descend Late moved,
and the man, lowering the blade, shrank back a little,
waiting for the boy to sink into slumber again.</p>
<p>Instead of quieting down, Late stretched out one
of his long arms, striking the intruder in the face,
and knocking him over. Both lad and man were
on their feet in an instant, one seeking to grapple
with the other, but the stranger, too quick for the
young scout, arose and disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>Joe, aroused by the brief struggle, sprang up crying
loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one crept in here to steal or to kill,&rdquo; was
the reply as the speaker darted out of the shack
to peer through the gloom, hoping to see or hear
something of the fugitive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But all was still, and, satisfied that the intruder had
made good his escape, he turned to Joe, &ldquo;I awoke
suddenly, an&rsquo; felt, rather than saw, a man on his
knees &rsquo;tween you an&rsquo; me. I swung my arm &rsquo;round
an&rsquo; knocked him over, an&rsquo; &rsquo;fore I could grab him
he vanished. If it wan&rsquo;t for the ache in my arm
where I whacked him, I should think I&rsquo;d been
dreamin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;spose it&rsquo;s safe to light a torch,&rdquo; his
companion whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it might give him the very chance he&rsquo;s
waitin&rsquo; for, an&rsquo; we better have our guns ready, in
case he sends a bullet this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seized the rifles and sat motionless a long
while, but the forest was as silent as if they alone
were in it. At length Late stepped softly out under
the trees until he could get a view of the stars, when
he went back to his comrade, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much more than midnight now, Joe.
Lie down an&rsquo; get what sleep you can. I&rsquo;ll call you
in &rsquo;bout two hours to take a spell of standin&rsquo; guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such manner they spent the remaining hours
of the night, and when it was light enough, made a
thorough search of the woods all around the encampment,
but not the slightest evidence could they find
that any one had been in that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give it up,&rdquo; Late finally said, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
get breakfast so&rsquo;s to be off. But I swaney, my arm
is still lame where I struck some one or something
last night. I know &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Half an hour later the boys were moving westward
again, and not until the sun was directly overhead
did they halt. Perhaps they might not have stopped
just then, but, on coming into a little clearing, the
lads caught sight of an old man cooking fish near
the river bank. A canoe was drawn up near him, in
which was the usual outfit of a voyager. He clearly
was not suspecting any danger, for his rifle lay in
the boat, and he made no effort to reach it on seeing
them. Instead he cried cheerily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, lads. Come along and have a bite
with your uncle David. There are fish enough for
three, and you are as welcome as if you had caught
and cooked them yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding their guns ready for instant use the boys
advanced, and he, noting their caution, laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put up your shooters, youngsters, for David
Daggett never yet hurt a human being, white or Indian.
It isn&rsquo;t his mission,&rdquo; and then, lowering his
voice as though he was imparting a profound secret,
he continued, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who it is? Haven&rsquo;t
you heard of me before?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Being told by the young scouts that they had never
seen or heard of him before, and, therefore, could
not know what his mission might be, he seemed disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard, eh? I thought the whole world
knew of me. I am David Daggett, and my mission is
to reckon up the birds of the forests. I have traveled
miles doing it, and do you see that one flying across
the river? He makes exactly twenty thousand I
have counted. It&rsquo;s slow work, lads, but David Daggett
will some day be able to tell just how many birds
there are in the Mohawk valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young scouts could but believe that the old
man was crazy. They laid down their rifles, threw
off the packs, and partook of the food which he, with
a liberal hand, gave them. When, however, the boys
would have contributed their share to the noon-day
meal, he stopped them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are my guests now,&rdquo;
and, with a cunning glance, &ldquo;though no one knows
where I get my money, I always have enough to buy
food for myself and my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>While they were eating he told them many things
about the birds which flew through the clearing.
Evidently he knew the names and was familiar with
the habits of all the feathered visitors, and as each
passed, he counted it, adding ten to his number before
the meal was at an end.</p>
<p>When the lads, thanking him for his hospitality,
arose to resume their journey, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you going up the river, my sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>He seemed lost in thought during a dozen seconds
or more, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, lads. You don&rsquo;t make fun of the old
man and his whims as some do, so I&rsquo;ll carry you a
piece up the river, though I&rsquo;ve just come down stream.
Get into the canoe; it will be a sight easier than
tramping, and save you many a mile around the
great swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe turned to Late, waiting for him to decide.
Both knew of the swamp not far away, and understood
that the old man was correct. It would be
easier, and much time might be saved by paddling
up the stream a few miles. They were two to one,
and it was broad daylight. Surely there could be no
risk in accepting Master Daggett&rsquo;s invitation, therefore
Late said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir; but let Joe and me take the paddles.
We know how to handle them, an&rsquo; oughter be
willin&rsquo; to do that much in return for your favor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The old man made no protest to this proposition,
and during two hours or more the boys drove the
light craft up the river until arriving at a considerable
waterfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to land here,&rdquo; the bird missionary
said, &ldquo;and carry the boat around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hardly ask you to take us any farther,&rdquo;
young Wentworth replied. &ldquo;We are now beyond
the swamp, an&rsquo; you have saved us a good five-mile
tramp, so we&rsquo;ll thank you again for your kindness,
an&rsquo; push on afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by any means,&rdquo; Master Daggett declared.
&ldquo;It makes no difference where I am. I find birds,
birds, everywhere. I have counted seventy-two since
we came up the river. I&rsquo;ll see more above the falls.
We&rsquo;ll go on together until night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys could not persuade him to any other
course, therefore they carried their packs above the
falls and returned for the canoe, the old man walking
by their side and assuring them he had not found
such pleasant companions for many a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear to part with you,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on together as long as you can get along
with the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The voyage above the falls differed greatly from
that below. There the course had been through an
unbroken wilderness; now they occasionally passed
small clearings, in which were the cabins of hardy
settlers; but they made no stops, and when the day
was nearly spent entered again a long tract of forest.
After having paddled another mile they came to
a series of rapids, where a portage became necessary.</p>
<p>To their urging that he accompany them no farther,
the old man grew indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay with you to-night,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go around the rapids, and then make camp.
You&rsquo;ll have to land on the south bank for the portage,
because the north side is impassable, except by making
a long detour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing this statement to be correct the boys
steered the canoe to the southern shore, and disembarked.
The lads carried their packs around the
rapids, while Master Daggett remained by the boat.
Returning in a few minutes, they waited for him to
shoulder his own traps, when they lifted the light
craft and followed the old man up the bank. Traveling
somewhat slower than he did, they had a chance
to talk over the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get rid of him,&rdquo; Late said in a whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Joe agreed. &ldquo;Let us cross over to the
other bank for our camp, and then we can slip away
in the mornin&rsquo; &rsquo;fore he wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bright idea,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Therefore when they arrived at the upper end of
the rapids, young Wentworth, turning to Master Daggett,
said carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a better place for a camp across the river,
Uncle David. Why can&rsquo;t we go over there for the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; the old man growled.
&ldquo;I never spend the night on the north side of the
river. It gives me rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; Late an&rsquo; I never camp on the south side; it
gives us the chills and fever,&rdquo; Joe retorted, thinking
the separation with the old bird missionary might as
well come then as in the morning, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ll get you
to set us across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the old man glared at him angrily,
then said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Stow in your traps. I&rsquo;ll leave mine
here, for I shall come back after taking you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased with their success the young scouts put
their packs into the light craft, and stepped in themselves.
The owner of the canoe followed, taking up
the paddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll row the boat across,&rdquo; Late said, reaching for
the oar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit where you are,&rdquo; was the stern command. &ldquo;I
can handle this craft without any of your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Master Daggett was in a surly mood,
but the lads cared little for that, so long as he granted
their request. With a vigorous stroke the old man
sent the boat into the middle of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can whirl it around and
around and around,&rdquo; and as he spoke he set the
canoe spinning with a rapidity that made his companions
dizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go down the rapids,&rdquo; he shouted, and
drove the craft straight toward the falls.</p>
<p>Satisfied that the old man had suddenly gone mad,
the lads sprang up to wrest the paddle from him,
when, with a loud yell, he leaped on the gunwale,
overturning the boat.</p>
<p>The water was deep, and the young scouts sank,
as a matter of course. Joe was the first to get his
head above the surface, only to find Master Daggett
on the lookout for him. Seizing the boy by the neck,
the crazy man forced him beneath the water again,
shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall drown! Now you shall drown!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Late got his head into the air just in time to
see this attack, and swam to his comrade&rsquo;s assistance.
But the old man caught him by his hair with a grip
as of iron, crying at the full strength of his lungs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drown you both, you young devils! I&rsquo;ll
drown you both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant Joe succeeded in freeing himself
from the grasp of the madman, and, nearly choked
though he was, sprang upon the old fellow&rsquo;s shoulders,
forcing him beneath the surface.</p>
<p>This proved to be a fortunate move, for, finding
himself in danger of drowning, Master Daggett let
go his hold of Late, and, by a tremendous effort threw
Joe off his back, swimming vigorously for the southern
shore. The boys, still believing him crazy, made
no attempt at pursuit; but struck out for the opposite
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Late cried as soon as he was out of the
water. &ldquo;If we hurry down below the falls we may
save our packs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve lost our guns,&rdquo; Joe added, following
his comrade as rapidly as his wet garments would
permit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>They found, despite the statement of the old man,
that there was a fair trail around the rapids on that
side, and were soon at the lower end. But, rapidly
as they moved, the lunatic outstripped them, and not
only secured the packs, but began dancing about with,
his rifle in hand, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot if you attempt to come over here! I&rsquo;ll
shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys watched him in silence a few minutes, and
then Joe exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty fix! Our rifles are lost, the
food is gone, we are wet to the skin, night is comin&rsquo;
on, I&rsquo;d like to know what we are goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to the upper end of the falls and build a
fire. Dry our clothes and camp out till mornin&rsquo;.
Then fish up the guns, an&rsquo; go our way!&rdquo; his comrade
said sharply, fumbling to see if the flint and steel
were still in his pocket.</p>
<p>When they gained the higher bank it was to find
that Master Daggett had been equally active, for
he stood on the opposite side, still threatening to shoot
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out of range before building a fire,&rdquo;
Late said as he led the way into the woods.</p>
<p>They soon came to a small clearing in which was
a huge oak tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a good place,&rdquo; Joe cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his companion admitted.</p>
<p>They soon had a fire built under the tree, on the
branches of which they hung their outer garments.
The inner clothing they took off, wrung out and put
on again, standing near the blaze to &ldquo;dry out,&rdquo; Joe
meanwhile scolding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk &rsquo;bout gainin&rsquo; time by takin&rsquo; to the canoe.
I guess we&rsquo;ll know better than listen to a madman
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure he is a madman,&rdquo; Late said with
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; his companion asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much method in his actions. Think
it over. He&rsquo;s managed to rob us of our guns an&rsquo;
packs, an&rsquo; put us in a place where we may easily be
shot down. I suspect he&rsquo;s the fellow who visited us
last night, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t believe that we have seen the
last of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; Joe replied after a time of
thought, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve got nothin&rsquo; but our knives to
fight him with. It looks dubious, Late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The hours passed drearily. The garments dried
slowly; there was nothing to eat; they could not
sleep while half-clad, and there was the danger that
the enemy would appear. Therefore they spent the
time gathering fuel, and in keeping guard lest they
be surprised. As the night grew older a cool breeze
sprang up, and the boys began to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to put on our clothes, even if they
are not entirely dry,&rdquo; Late at length said, leaning
over to feel of the garments.</p>
<p>Just as he stretched out his hand the sharp crack
of a rifle rang out, and a bullet whistled close to his
head. Then came a second report, and Joe, who appeared
to be the target, dodged behind the huge oak.</p>
<p>His comrade joined him, and from behind this
shelter they peered into the darkness mystified by the
rapid firing. Then, from the rear could be heard a
third report, and a ball buried itself in the tree-trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are surrounded!&rdquo; Late exclaimed in a low
tone. &ldquo;Quick! We must run before they have time
to re-load. It&rsquo;s our only hope of escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hatless, bootless, without breeches, coat or vest,
the two scouts fled into the darkness, running as they
never had before.</p>
<p>During a short time they heard the sound of footsteps,
as of some one in pursuit, and then the noise
grew fainter and fainter until it finally died away.
The boys halted beneath a great pine, panting heavily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are as safe here as anywhere,&rdquo; young Wentworth
declared, &ldquo;and may as well stay where we are
until mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrade made no answer for a full minute,
when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand those three shots. Where
could old Daggett have found any one to help
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but there must
have been three in the party. No one had time to re-load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the moments passed, and then Joe spoke
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back, an&rsquo; see if they have taken our clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was not pleasing, and yet they could
devise no other plan. If the hours had been long
and dreary at the camp-fire, they were now tedious.
Yet the young scouts made the best of a bad matter,
and at the coming of day crept back to the clearing,
only to find it deserted. There, in the slumbering
coals, were the charred remains of their boots,
their garments, and their guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>When Late&rsquo;s eye fell on the stockless barrels of the
weapons, he exclaimed in anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Daggett was the only one here last night!
See, Joe, he fished out our rifles, and cleaned and
re-loaded them before attacking us! After driving
us away he burned everything, and cleared out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To confirm this supposition they went back to the
river, and looked over to the opposite side where they
had last seen their enemy. His traps were gone. The
great forest had swallowed him and them.</p>
<p>During a moment only did the discomfited lads
stand there inactive. Then, turning their faces for
the third time westward, hungry, footsore, unarmed,
scantily clad, yet undaunted, they set out through
the forest toward their destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">UNFURLING THE FLAG.</span></h2>
<p>After traveling a mile or two the young scouts
came to a break in the forest, where the big trees
gave place to low bushes covered with wild berries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is our breakfast,&rdquo; Late said, helping himself
to the sweet, delicious fruit. Joe followed his
example, and not until their keen appetites were somewhat
appeased did the boys resume their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose blueberries are very lastin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Joe
muttered as they went on, &ldquo;but they are better than
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll last until we get somethin&rsquo; more substantial,&rdquo;
his companion replied, as he turned sharply into
a rough cart path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does this lead to?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more than you do,&rdquo; was the answer;
&ldquo;but it will bring us to a settlement of some
kind, where we can get help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;What if the owner is a Tory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be Tories,&rdquo; was the decisive response.
&ldquo;We need food, arms, and clothes, an&rsquo; some friend
or foe must furnish them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Latham was evidently fast approaching a desperate
mood.</p>
<p>Before many moments they arrived at a cultivated
field, and saw below them a valley of considerable size,
in which were a large house, barns, cabins, and other
outbuildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a place,&rdquo; Late exclaimed as he and his comrade
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; whoever lives there ought&rsquo;er be able to
furnish us with everything we need. But how are
we goin&rsquo; to find out whether the people are for the
colonies or the king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By those chaps there,&rdquo; was the reply, and the
speaker pointed to two small boys, who, with baskets
on their arms, had just clambered over a wall farther
down the hillside. &ldquo;They are goin&rsquo; berryin&rsquo;. Draw
back so they can&rsquo;t see you till they get here. We
don&rsquo;t want to scare them to death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The young scouts drew back from the brink of the
slope until hidden from view of the approaching lads,
and waited. Five minutes later the youngsters came
in sight, but were so busy wrangling over some matter
as not to take heed of the half-clad strangers until
almost upon them. Then their first inclination was
to run away; but under the assurance of Late that
they would in no way be harmed, the children drew
nearer, staring with wondering eyes at the sorry
objects they beheld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives down there?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the elder of the boys replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what is his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram Le Geyt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts looked at each other in dismay an instant;
then Late asked: &ldquo;Have you a brother Ira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s serving the king,&rdquo; the younger lad
said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your father at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the other boy replied, evidently eager to
impart information as well as his brother; &ldquo;he has
gone to Oswego to see Colonel St. Leger. He&rsquo;s going
to show him the way down here so he can lick the
rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the tall scout said grimly. &ldquo;Who
is at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma and Grandmother, Lucy, Jane, Hiram, and
me,&rdquo; the lad explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Grandpa,&rdquo; added the younger boy quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, and Grandpa,&rdquo; was the prompt assent. &ldquo;I
forgot him, he&rsquo;s away so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have been well for the questioner if he
had asked more about &ldquo;grandpa,&rdquo; but another matter
seemed more important just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we could get some old clothes down
there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And something to eat?&rdquo; Joe added, perhaps because
he thought that was fully as important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; both boys replied. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;s awful
good to the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts laughed. &ldquo;That fits us,&rdquo; Joe cried,
and they started down the slope almost on the run.
They arrived at the big barn first, and entered
it to find a negro at work. He stared at them a moment
in amazement, and then asked gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be ye? What ye doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were comin&rsquo; up the river last night, an&rsquo; our
boat capsized,&rdquo; Late explained. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go to
the house an&rsquo; get us some clothes an&rsquo; food? Tell Mistress
Le Geyt we know Ira, who is with General
Burgoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>After a little persuasion the servant went off with
their message. He was absent some time, but finally
appeared with his arms full of old clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missus says ye are to get inter these, an&rsquo; then
come to the house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She wants to talk
with ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys put on the garments, finding that they
fitted fairly well, and then, conducted by the negro,
went to the dwelling. Showing them into the living
room, the colored man said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down. Missus will be here soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later a woman of about forty years
entered, and with a smile said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caesar tells me you are friends of my eldest son
Ira, who is with General Burgoyne. May I ask
your names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her visitors told her in turn. &ldquo;Latham Wentworth
and Joseph Fisher,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
recall the names; that is, I don&rsquo;t recollect that Ira
ever spoke of you. How long have you known my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few weeks,&rdquo; Late answered. &ldquo;We met
him first up at Lake Champlain, while he was waitin&rsquo;
for the army to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;We work under him,&rdquo; Joe added. Then a bright
thought came to his mind. &ldquo;He carries an iron
cross that can be taken apart, so he can hide his
papers in it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;He shows it to the
Indians, an&rsquo; they let him come an go &rsquo;mong them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now that you are indeed his friends,&rdquo; she
cried joyously, &ldquo;for I gave him that cross myself.
It is an heirloom in our family. But how do you
happen to be here? C&aelig;sar said you were capsized
on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not tell every one, good Mistress Le
Geyt,&rdquo; Late said in a low but significant tone, &ldquo;but
we do not mind tellin&rsquo; you that we are sent up
country on a special mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head in a way that indicated she
understood him, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led them out into a great hall, where on a
rack of deer horns were several rifles and fowling-pieces.
Seeing that her visitors noticed the arms, she
said as they passed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have quite an arsenal. It is because all our
men folks are fond of gunning; my husband, Ira,
grandpa, and even the younger boys have their own
favorite weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Coming to the great staircase, they ascended and
entered a large chamber, where, spread out on the
bed, were two costly hunting suits, and beside it
two pairs of hunting boots, scarcely worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for sending those old garments
out to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They might do for strangers,
but not for friends of my boy&rsquo;s. Those on the bed
are much more suitable, and by the time you have
put them on, breakfast will be ready,&rdquo; and she left
them to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t know ourselves,&rdquo; Joe cried as he began
to put on the finer garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all due to that happy thought of
yours regarding the iron cross. What do you s&rsquo;pose
she&rsquo;d say if she knew our Ira wasn&rsquo;t her Ira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; his comrade cautioned. &ldquo;Some one is
goin&rsquo; down the hall, an&rsquo; might hear you. But I do
feel a little &rsquo;shamed to impose on so fine a woman as
Mistress Le Geyt seems to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know &rsquo;bout that,&rdquo; was the low reply.
&ldquo;One enemy robs us; another makes it good. Sort
of evens up things, it &rsquo;pears to me. Though I confess
I wish it was Master Le Geyt we were imposin&rsquo;
on, instead of his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>A bell now rang loudly at the foot of the stairs,
and, taking it for the signal to come to breakfast, the
young scouts hastened down to the lower hall where
they found their hostess waiting. She led them into
a large dining-room, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, and Matilda will wait on you. I shall
have to ask you to excuse me for a while, as I have
some household duties that must be attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thus speaking she left the apartment by another
door, and in another moment a negress came in
to attend to their needs.</p>
<p>Fried chicken, vegetables, bread, pie, cheese, and
coffee were furnished them in abundance by the
waitress, who seemed delighted at their enormous
appetites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye makes me think of Master Ira,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always mighty hungry when he&rsquo;s been on a
long tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length they could eat no more, and arose to
leave the table, when the hall door was suddenly
thrown open, and David Daggett strode in, followed
by four stout negroes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize those rebels,&rdquo; he said to the men. &ldquo;Stand
still, you young devils,&rdquo; he cried to the surprised
lads, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll fire,&rdquo; and he leveled a pistol at
each.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>In another minute they were surrounded, dragged
from the room into the hall, carried bodily up the
stairway, and thrust into a back chamber, whose windows
were covered with heavy shutters securely fastened
on the outside. Then the door was closed and
locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have you at last,&rdquo; an exulting voice called from
without. &ldquo;You may fool Sarah, but you cannot fool
David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gloom the prisoners gazed into each other&rsquo;s
faces for some time before either uttered a word.
Then Joe exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of a thing like this afore, Late!
Here you an&rsquo; me have put ourselves right into that
old man&rsquo;s hands. I reckon he&rsquo;s the grandpa those
boys told about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he is,&rdquo; his comrade replied. &ldquo;Do you
s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;ll take these clothes from us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. I never had such a good suit before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day passed; night came, as the prisoners could
tell by peering through the cracks in the window
shutters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they starve us?&rdquo; Joe asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
hungry as when we first came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I,&rdquo; Late replied. &ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s
any way out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>He went from window to window, examining carefully
and trying the shutters in turn. Neither alone,
nor with Joe&rsquo;s help could he move them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here to stay,&rdquo; he said in a despondent
tone.</p>
<p>But he was mistaken. About midnight a key was
thrust into the lock, the bolt turned back, and the
door opened. There stood the negro they had seen at
the barn in the morning, with a candle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>They followed him down the stairs and into the
dining-room, where they found an abundance of food
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; he said grimly.</p>
<p>Without a word they obeyed, and when their hunger
was appeased, he led them back to the hall in front
of the rack of arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take two,&rdquo; he directed. Each lad took a rifle,
with horn and pouch, and followed him again, this
time through the front door into the yard.</p>
<p>Leading them around to the barn, he showed them
two horses, saddled and bridled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re yourn,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Go down that
lane to the road. Turn to the left, and you&rsquo;ll be at
Little Falls &rsquo;fore mornin&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s a note from Missus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>He thrust the paper into Late&rsquo;s hand. Then the
lads mounted and rode slowly away. A half-mile
beyond the house they came to the road of which the
negro had spoken. Turning into this they galloped
along as rapidly as the rough way and darkness
would permit. At dawn the tiny settlement was in
sight. Pausing to rest the panting steeds, they
opened and read Mistress Le Geyt&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear guests,&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;I regret greatly
that my father, David Daggett, imprisoned you. He
is not quite himself, and insists that you are rebels.
No persuasion of mine can convince him you are
Ira&rsquo;s friends. He declares he saw you come from
the lines of the enemy, and followed you all the way
up the river. I suspect your misfortunes were due
to him, and, as far as possible, make restitution.
C&aelig;sar will fix your room so that it will look as if
you made your own escape. Tell Ira, when you see
him, that I did all I could in your behalf, for his
sake. Your friend,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sarah Le Geyt</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Late,&rdquo; Joe exclaimed after they had
read the note, &ldquo;these horses are goin&rsquo; back to that
woman! The clothes an&rsquo; guns I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to keep in
the place of those that crazy old David burned; but
I won&rsquo;t take anything more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s the proper figure,&rdquo; his companion
said after a little thought. &ldquo;We can send them back
from the settlement. It&rsquo;s less than forty miles to
the fort, an&rsquo; by hard walkin&rsquo; we can fetch there &rsquo;fore
midnight. Can&rsquo;t you write a note tellin&rsquo; her why we
send the horses back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much at writin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Joe replied; &ldquo;but I
can fix up somethin&rsquo;. Guess we can get what&rsquo;s needed
on ahead here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young scouts were more fortunate than they
had expected. At the falls they met a man who
wanted to go down the river to his home, a few
miles below Hiram Le Geyt&rsquo;s. He readily consented
to take the animals back, and deliver their letter to
the mistress. Therefore Joe, with some suggestions
from Late, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Good Mistress Le Geyt: We are rebels, so we
send back your horses. We keep the other things
&rsquo;cause your father destroyed ours. We can&rsquo;t tell
you how we came to know &rsquo;bout Ira. Thank you for
all you did for us. We&rsquo;ll be kind to the next Tory
we meet, for your sake. Good-by.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Late and Joe.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel better,&rdquo; the latter said, when the man,
who was taking back the horses, had disappeared.
&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem as though we&rsquo;d imposed on that woman
quite so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wonderin&rsquo; if she&rsquo;d have been so kind to us
had she known we were rebels,&rdquo; his comrade said.
&ldquo;Howsomever, we&rsquo;ve ben purty square with her,
seein&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a Tory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later they set out for the fort,
striking off through the forest, as their custom had
been, instead of following the regular trail, a fact
which saved them from another encounter with David
Daggett, for he, with a half-dozen servants at his
heels, had come in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>But they, ignorant of all this, tramped steadily
along mile after mile, stopping but once for a brief
rest, and about nine o&rsquo;clock that night delivered their
message to the commander of the fort, Captain Abraham
Swartwout.</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands gleefully when they told of
reinforcements on the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can hold out until they get here, even if St.
Leger sweeps down on me with his whole force,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that Indian business, though.
It means burning and butchering all the way from
Oswego here. Some one ought to go up along the
road, warning the settlers, and telling them to come
in here with their families for protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go,&rdquo; the young scouts said in the same
breath. &ldquo;General Schuyler told us to remain as
long as we could be of any service to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rest to-night and to-morrow,&rdquo; the captain
replied, &ldquo;for you need it. Monday morning I&rsquo;ll
send you out for the double purpose of warning the
settlers, and watching the movements of the red-coats.
I&rsquo;ll arrange a set of signals by which you can let me
know what is going on outside, without coming into
the fort. You&rsquo;ll run less risk of being discovered
and shot down;&rdquo; then he called an orderly who took
them first to the mess room, where they were given
supper, and then to the barracks. In an hour both
were sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>The following day the young scouts &ldquo;did nothin&rsquo;
but sleep and eat,&rdquo; as Late expressed it, but immediately
after breakfast on Monday they went to the
commander&rsquo;s quarters. He received them kindly
and led the way to one of the bastions. From
there he pointed out a tall tree on a hill opposite,
asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that big pine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the lads replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is across the river, and likely to be beyond
the lines of the enemy when they are besieging the
garrison. Here are four strips of cloth, red, black,
white, and green, each of which will have a different
meaning when tied in the top of that tree. The white
will be taken that reinforcements are close at hand;
the red, that they have been discovered and are about
to be attacked; the green, that they need help; the
black, that they have been defeated. The red and
white will tell me that the Indians are deserting the
British; the red and green, that the British are about
to be attacked in the rear; the red and black, that
they have been defeated; while the white and green
will signify that they are advancing on the fort; and
the white and black that they are preparing to give
up the siege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys repeated these instructions until they had
them fixed in mind, and then Joe said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see these colors in the night, captain.
We might want to signal then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are only for the day; we will have another
arrangement for the night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Can
either of you hoot like an owl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; both of us,&rdquo; Late replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then one hoot takes the place of the white, two
of the red, three of the green, and four of the black.
From that you can make up your combinations,&rdquo; the
officer explained. &ldquo;These cries are to be given
from the tree, and the man stationed on this bastion
will be prepared to report them promptly to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir, we&rsquo;ll do our best to keep you
posted on all outside movements,&rdquo; Late promised,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; should anything occur that you ought&rsquo;er know,
which can&rsquo;t be reported by signals, we&rsquo;ll bring it in
to you at the risk of our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be something very important, then,&rdquo; Captain
Swartwout replied with a smile, after which he
led the young scouts to the great gate of the fort,
where he bade them Godspeed.</p>
<p>During several days they were busy among the
settlements for many miles around. In some cases
their warnings were promptly heeded, and the people
fled to the fort in time to escape the Indians, who in
a few days were scouring the entire region in search
of victims. Others delayed too long, and fell a prey
to the merciless foe. Before arriving at Oswego, the
young scouts themselves were compelled to turn back
before the advance guard of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>By exercising great caution, however, they kept
just out of reach, and yet near enough to make out
the movements of the enemy.</p>
<p>One night, as they stealthily avoided a small party
of Indians that had made camp on the banks of Wood
Creek, the young scouts became aware that some one
else was engaged in the same work as themselves.
Eager to learn who he was, they followed his trail
for some distance through the brush. At length the
man emerged into an open space, where the moonlight
fell upon him, and with suppressed exclamations
of surprise both lads recognized their old enemy,
David Daggett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he is doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; Joe whispered
in his comrade&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Late replied in the same cautious
manner.</p>
<p>Therefore when Daggett moved on, they kept as
close to his heels as was possible with safety to themselves.
Having passed the Indian camp, he walked
rapidly, with the air of one who knows where he is
going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bound for the British army,&rdquo; Late said,
speaking scarcely above his breath. &ldquo;Probably he
has a message of some kind. I wish we could find out
what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Fortune soon favored them, and in a way they
little expected. A half-mile farther on the old man
was hailed by a picket. To the call, &ldquo;Who goes
there?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; and received the
customary direction: &ldquo;Advance, friend, and give the
countersign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Master Daggett could not do, and for some
time he parleyed with the guard, trying to persuade
the man to allow him to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a loyal subject of the king,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and
have come with important news for your commander.
Let me go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sentinel was firm. Then the Tory grew
angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show,&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;that you have no right
to stop me. Your own commander will come to let
me in,&rdquo; and he drew from his pocket a small silver
bugle. Putting this to his lips, he sounded a few
sharp, shrill notes. Twice he repeated the call, and
then, restoring the instrument to his pocket, calmly
folded his arms and waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>A moment later the captain of the guard, followed
by a squad of soldiers, came running down to the
post where, finding the sentinel with his gun trained
on an old man who stood a few rods distant with
folded arms, he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean? Who blew those bugle
notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the picket could speak Master Daggett answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a call to your commander.
Step one side, please, and wait. He&rsquo;ll be here in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely it was a call to the enemy,&rdquo; the
officer cried angrily. &ldquo;Here, boys, seize that fellow
and bring him into camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That command will cost you your commission,
young man,&rdquo; the old Tory said sternly. &ldquo;And,
soldiers, unless you want to go to the guard-house,
you&rsquo;d better keep your hands off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize him, boys; we&rsquo;ll find a way to put a stop
to his nonsense,&rdquo; the officer cried, running forward
at the head of his men; but before he could touch the
old man, a stern voice in the rear cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that man alone, and go back to your stations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They knew the voice and obeyed, leaving the triumphant
Tory face to face with their commander
and a second man in the dress of a civilian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, colonel! Hello, Hiram!&rdquo; was Master
Daggett&rsquo;s salutation. &ldquo;I thought those bugle notes
would fetch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you call, father?&rdquo; the man in plain
clothes asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because yonder numskull wouldn&rsquo;t let me in,&rdquo;
was the angry reply, &ldquo;and now I won&rsquo;t go in for
anybody. If you want to hear my news, you&rsquo;ll have
to get it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picket was only obeying orders,&rdquo; Hiram Le
Geyt said in a soothing tone. &ldquo;Come up to the colonel&rsquo;s
tent. You can give us your tidings there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; screamed the old man,
jumping up and down. &ldquo;Let General Herkimer
come with his eight hundred men and reinforce the
garrison, if he wants to. Let him camp at Oriskany,
where he can be surprised before morning and defeated,
for all of me. I would have given you the
chance of your life, but you are all fools, fools, fools!
Not one of you knows enough to strike a good blow
for the king. I&rsquo;ll leave you alone, and let the rebels
walk right by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had now worked himself into such a passion
that he pulled his hair, tore his whiskers, and stamped
upon the ground in a fury.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>It was Colonel St. Leger who pacified him. He
laid his hand on the old man&rsquo;s arm, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is men like you, Master Daggett, that I need.
You must advise me, yes, lead my troops to the place
where I can destroy that Yankee force. Come with
me, and we will arrange for the forced march which
will be necessary if we are to reach Oriskany before
sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soothing words, the gentle touch, calmed the
raging man, and soon he followed the officer and his
son-in-law into the lines.</p>
<p>As the three disappeared the young scouts arose
from their hiding-place, and crept off down the creek.
For three miles they moved in silence, and then, coming
to a place where the trail emerged into another,
both paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and signal the fort,&rdquo; Late said to his comrade
in a whisper. &ldquo;I will warn General Herkimer,&rdquo;
and he hastened along the trail leading southeasterly.</p>
<p>Joe gained the great pine, and, climbing into its
branches, gave the hoots which told the listening sentinel
that the approaching reinforcements were to be
attacked. Then he slipped to the ground, intending
to follow his comrade to Oriskany, when he was seized
by two Indians. A desperate struggle followed, but
at length the lad succeeded in breaking away from
his captors, and ran toward the fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The report of a rifle rang out, and the fugitive
spun around like a top until he fell to the ground.
The lad regained his feet in an instant, however,
and sped on, but his right arm hung limply by his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get into the fort,&rdquo; he thought as he ran
into the river. Crossing it, he hurried on, and ten
minutes later was pounding at the great gate. The
guard heard him, and called the officer of the night,
when he was taken in and put under the surgeon&rsquo;s
care.</p>
<p>No one warned General Herkimer of the foe, and
at sunrise he was on the move anxious to traverse
the six miles which separated him from the waiting
garrison. While passing through a dense wood he
was suddenly attacked by a heavy force of the enemy,
who poured in a terrific fire from both sides, cutting
down his men like swaths of grass. A terrible
hand-to-hand fight ensued. General Herkimer seemed
to be everywhere, gallantly directing his men. At
length he fell, mortally wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, boys,&rdquo; he called to two men near him,
&ldquo;pick me up, and place me against yonder tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>They did so, and then, taking his pipe from his
pocket, the brave commander filled and lighted it.
Puffing slowly away, he directed his men in a struggle
which, owing to the superior numbers of the
enemy, seemed hopeless. But unexpected help was
at hand. After Captain Swartwout heard from the
lips of the wounded scout the full particulars of the
proposed attack he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Leger will not come here until after that battle.
I may as well have a hand in it,&rdquo; and, therefore,
leading an hundred picked men, he hurried toward
Oriskany. Falling upon the rear of the red-coats
just as they were about to claim a victory, he put
them to flight.</p>
<p>Before they could realize the weakness of the reinforcements
and rally again, he, with the wounded
hero and the remnant of his gallant force, beat a
safe retreat to the garrison.</p>
<p>That evening he sat beside the cot of Joe Fisher,
telling him of the events of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Late did not find the general,&rdquo; the lad said
sadly. &ldquo;I wonder what happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear he fell into the hands of the British,&rdquo; the
captain replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they badly whipped?&rdquo; asked the lad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so but that they have been able to surround
the fort,&rdquo; the officer replied. &ldquo;We are hemmed in
at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there will be a battle here?&rdquo; the boy continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have a banner, captain!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joe, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the officer asked.</p>
<p>Eagerly the scout told him of the Act of Congress,
and, describing the appearance of the miniature flag
he had seen, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we have one made, Captain Swartwout, to
float from the highest bastion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; the commander replied. &ldquo;I have a
tailor in the fort. He shall make it to-night under
your directions, and we&rsquo;ll unfurl it at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later the tailor was at work. Sheets
were cut for the white stripes, bits of scarlet cloth
joined to form the red, and the blue ground for the
stars was made from a cloak belonging to the captain.
At sunrise, amid the cheers of the men and a
salute of thirteen cannon, it was swung to the breeze
from the highest staff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Colonel St. Leger saw and gazed in wonder at it
for some time. Then he sent for a prisoner whom
some of his Indians had captured the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The captive, a lad of perhaps eighteen years, looked
at the floating banner and replied with a grin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? Why, it&rsquo;s the new flag of a new nation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a great oath the enraged officer cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the first and the last time it will ever confront
a British army, for I shall carry it away with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">CLIPPING THE RIGHT WING.</span></h2>
<p>The young prisoner in the British camp, as the
reader may have surmised, was Latham Wentworth.
How he came to be there is easily explained.</p>
<p>After parting with Joe at the junction of the trails,
he traveled with the same caution as when coming
down Wood Creek, lest he might happen upon straggling
Indians. After a time, however, he believed
there was no longer any danger of falling in with the
savages, and carelessly advanced regardless of
noise. Then, from the top of a small hill, he saw the
glimmer of fires in the Continental camp and, increasing
his speed, took the most direct line through
the woods.</p>
<p>A small party of Indians, however, separated from
the main force earlier in the day, had wandered so
far east of the garrison as to be attracted by the
same camp-fires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Unconscious of danger, Late continued on his
course until, before he had heard anything to cause
alarm, five savages leaped upon him. One seized his
rifle; two threw him to the ground; a fourth clapped
his hands over the captive&rsquo;s mouth to prevent an
outcry, while the remaining Indian proceeded to tie
the lad&rsquo;s hands behind him. Then they picked him
up and hurried through the woods for some distance.
Finding, however, they were not followed they soon
put the prisoner on his feet, and, compelling him to
keep pace with themselves, carried him to their encampment.
Thrusting him into a wigwam they
placed a guard over him and the young scout was
left alone until morning.</p>
<p>On the following day, when the Indian encampment
was changed to the vicinity of Fort Stanwix, Late
was taken along as a matter of course, and, later,
brought with other prisoners to Colonel St. Leger
for his personal inspection.</p>
<p>By the side of the colonel stood David Daggett and
Hiram Le Geyt, and immediately the old Tory saw
Late he gave vent to a cry of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you at last!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got you at last!&rdquo; and then to the commander and his
son-in-law he told how he had followed the prisoner
and his comrade on their journey from the Hudson to
the fort. The attempt to kill them, the overturning
of the boat at the falls, driving the half-clad boys
into the woods, the destruction of their property, their
visit to the farm, and his further pursuit, were all
rapidly related. Then he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young devils have more lives than a cat. I
couldn&rsquo;t kill them. But now that you have this one,
why not string him up to the nearest tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hardly do that,&rdquo; the colonel replied.
&ldquo;He is not a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; Master Daggett shouted. &ldquo;He was
caught because of hanging around your encampment
trying to spy out what was being done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a scout, or courier, but hardly a
spy,&rdquo; the officer persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is his entering my house, deceiving my wife,
and running off with my property, to pass unnoticed?&rdquo;
interrupted Hiram Le Geyt. &ldquo;The very
clothes he wears belong to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel St. Leger was silent for a moment, and then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot condemn and hang him, according to
military rules; but I might turn him over to the
Indians. They would make short work of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is it. Let them kill the fellow at the
stake!&rdquo; cried the old Tory in glee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and
watch the flames as they curl around him. Ah! it
will be a great sight to see him sizzle and burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deserves the fate,&rdquo; the younger Tory said angrily.
&ldquo;Let the savages have him, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British commander, naturally more humane
than his Tory friends, appeared to be shocked by the
cruel proposal. He hesitated to give an order which
would send the lad to the stake; but finally said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go with the other prisoners now. I
will decide later what is to be done with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the next morning when the young scout, unmindful
of the terrible fate which might be his, declared
that the banner floating over the fort was the
flag of a new nation, the officer in his wrath sent for
the men who had made the capture, and turned the
lad over to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is your prisoner. Do what you please with
him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Therefore back to the Indian encampment Late
was taken, and a day or two after a council was summoned
to decide his fate. The terrible slaughter of
the savages during the battle of Oriskany, and the
fact that the captive had been found in the vicinity
of that place, may have had something to do with
the sentence imposed. He was condemned to the
stake.</p>
<p>Just before sunset, surrounded by a score of braves,
he was taken across the river and tied to a small
tree, whose branches had been trimmed away for that
purpose. Around him the fagots were piled, and
the death dance was begun.</p>
<p>Pale, but unflinching, the heroic lad watched the
grotesque dancing, at the ending of which he knew
the flames would be kindled. It was not the form
of death he would have chosen, but, after all, it would
soon be over, and what difference did it make? He
had long since given his life to the Cause, and if this
was the method by which the sacrifice was to be made,
he would die like a man.</p>
<p>The dance was at an end, and two of the savages,
taking brands from a fire which had been kindled
near-by, came toward the helpless boy. In another
instant they would have kindled the wood about him;
but at the critical moment a great shout was raised,
and some one, darting out from the thicket, dashed
across the little clearing to push aside both braves
with one sweep of his strong arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Late had hardly more than understood that the
newcomer was his friend, Ira Le Geyt, when the latter,
holding aloft his iron cross, poured forth in the
native tongue a torrent of words which held fixed the
attention of the Indian band. When the speech was
ended, each savage brandished his weapons, as he
hurried across the river toward the camp with loud
yells, leaving the two lads alone.</p>
<p>Drawing his knife, Ira cut the cords that bound
the young scout to the tree, saying as he did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just in time, Late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you were,&rdquo; was the emphatic reply. &ldquo;But
how came you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too long a story to repeat now. I will tell
you later, and you can explain how you happened to
be in this fix. But now I must go to the British
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; his companion cried. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
go there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Hiram Le Geyt and his father-in-law,
David Daggett, are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I came pretty near getting into a bad
scrape!&rdquo; Ira exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, suppose we go into
the forest, where we shall be less likely to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Soon they were sitting under the great pine, which
Captain Swartwout had pointed out as a signal station,
and Late told his story, concluding by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Joe is now I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have sent word to the commander about
the attack on General Herkimer,&rdquo; Ira said half to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Have you heard anything
about the battle?&rdquo; Late asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I met two or three of the soldiers who had
been separated from the main body during the fight.
Because you failed to see the general, he knew nothing
about the ambush, and walked directly into it.
A hand to hand fight followed, and the general himself
was wounded; but with his back against a tree,
he lighted his pipe, and, puffing away, directed his
men in what seemed a hopeless struggle. Then came
reinforcements, the men who told me did not know
where from, that attacked the British forces in
the rear, driving them back. It was then that the
soldiers I saw became separated from their companions,
and all they could guess was, that our army,
having dispersed the red-coats, went on to the
Fort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;The reinforcements must have come from there,&rdquo;
Late declared, &ldquo;and it shows that Joe gave the warning.
We&rsquo;ll know about it later. But now tell me
how you happen to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to the time you left me,&rdquo; Ira said,
and related all the incidents already known to the
reader, down to the defeat of Colonel Baum at Bennington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got back to Fort Edward, I found General
Burgoyne in an ugly frame of mind. Baum&rsquo;s
defeat deprived him of the stores he so sadly needed.
No word had come from Clinton, and nothing had
been heard from St. Leger. In his desperation he
decided to send me up here to hurry the colonel down
the valley. He is afraid to attack our forces at
Bemis Heights until he receives reinforcements. Of
course I got word to General Schuyler before beginning
the journey, and he suggested a plan which,
judging from the flight of those Indians, will prove
a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to them?&rdquo; Late interrupted.
&ldquo;I never saw redskins run as they did after your
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told them,&rdquo; his friend replied, &ldquo;that Colonel
Arnold was coming with a large force, and would
capture them all if they did not run away. The
cross was proof to them that my message was true.
Before to-morrow morning the entire Indian force
will hear the news, and vanish like fog before the
rising sun. In two days St. Leger will have only
his regulars to confront our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll whip him as the patriots whipped
Baum at Bennington,&rdquo; Late cried with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only regret is that I cannot go to the colonel
with the message I had,&rdquo; Ira said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to tell him of Baum&rsquo;s defeat, Clinton&rsquo;s
failure to meet Burgoyne&rsquo;s demands, and the latter&rsquo;s
critical condition before an overwhelming force,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;I hoped to discourage him so he would
go back into Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late remained silent a few moments as though
thinking the matter over. Then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make up a report from General Burgoyne,
bringin&rsquo; in all those things, an&rsquo; advisin&rsquo; him
to give up his campaign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make up the report readily enough,&rdquo; his
companion admitted. &ldquo;The difficult thing is to send
it in such a way that he will believe it comes from
his chief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to one of the Indians,&rdquo; was the quick
suggestion; &ldquo;he can make any explanation you have
a mind to give him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira laughed. &ldquo;What is that old saying?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;&lsquo;Two heads are better than one&rsquo;? I believe
we can make the scheme work. It is getting
too dark to write the message to-night; but I will prepare
it early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went back a little farther into the woods,
built a temporary shack, and, after partaking of some
food Ira had with him, took turns in sleeping and
watching until dawn.</p>
<p>After breakfast young Le Geyt took from his pack
the necessary writing materials, and, &ldquo;as General
Burgoyne&rsquo;s secretary,&rdquo; so he said in sport, wrote
a letter to Colonel St. Leger, telling of the misfortunes
which his commander had experienced, setting
forth the direful condition he was in, and urging the
colonel to come to his assistance; but adding, &ldquo;If,
however, you find it impossible to do so within a
few days, then, to save yourself and men from capture,
you had better abandon the campaign and return
to Quebec, for I hear the rebels are sending a
large force against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he read to his companion, who said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll fix him. Once he gets them idees into
his head, he&rsquo;ll run away faster than the redskins
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on to the Indian camp and find some one
to carry this to headquarters. Will you be here when
I get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in call,&rdquo; Late replied. &ldquo;But, say,
how near is Colonel Arnold and his men? Perhaps
I ought to signal Captain Swartwout that they are
comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed them near Little Falls, and, of course,
traveled faster than they can. To-morrow will be
ample time to give warning of their approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; but give me those lines an&rsquo; hooks I
saw in your pack, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have some fish cookin&rsquo;
when you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave my outfit here, and then you may help
yourself to anything that is needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several hours before he returned to find
that Late had kept his promise, for half a dozen fine
fish were ready to serve. As they were eating them
Ira related his experiences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before I got to the Indian encampment, I saw
a young brave slowly crawling toward it. Watching
him, I soon understood that he had been wounded and
was trying to get back to his friends, therefore I
quickened my steps to overtake him. Upon first
seeing me he was alarmed; but when I showed my
cross and spoke in his own tongue, he dismissed all
fears and told me his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in the battle at Oriskany and got a bullet
in his body which for a time rendered him unconscious.
When he came to himself the fighting was
over, and, fearing he might be found and made
captive, he crept into a thicket near a small brook,
staying there until his wound was partially healed.
Since then he had been endeavoring to get back to
the camp. I did not leave him until he was safe
with his own people, for he proved to be a chief of
high rank. But the exertion had been too much for
him, and before his friends could do anything, he
died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw my chance at once for getting the letter
I carried into the hands of the colonel. Watching
for a favorable moment, I concealed it on the person
of the dead chief, and waited for it to be discovered.
Within half an hour it was brought to me with the
question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it? Who is it for?&lsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretending to be surprised at the finding, I explained
that it was a message of some kind, and was
intended for Colonel St Leger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It should be carried to him at once,&rsquo; I declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately a brother of the dead man hurried
off to headquarters with it. Fearing there might
be an investigation into the circumstances attending
the discovery of the letter, I hurriedly visited the
other tribes in the encampment, learning that many
of the savages had already left for their villages, and
that others were preparing to go. My announcement
to the Indian squad last night was clearly beginning
to bear fruit; but I added a little more seed as I went
from band to band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I had gone the rounds, I left the encampment
and sought the shelter of the forest. Choosing
a spot where I could watch the Indians, I remained
several hours, noting with no little pleasure that every
few minutes a squad of savages went away. More
than two hundred must have left while I sat there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the red-coats make any effort to stop
them?&rdquo; Late asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by the way the British officers were continually
coming and going, I should say they did,&rdquo;
was the answer; &ldquo;and once I saw a delegation of
chiefs marching to Colonel St. Leger&rsquo;s headquarters,
probably for a council with him. But the yeast is
working, and he cannot prevent the stampede which
has already begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wonder where that redskin got the
message,&rdquo; young Wentworth said with a chuckle of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and who the white man was that came
and went so suddenly. But I can stand the mystery
if he can,&rdquo; was the laughing reply.</p>
<p>Next morning the Indian encampment was so
nearly deserted that Ira advised that the fact be
signaled the fort. Climbing the great pine, Late
took from the lining of his coat the strips of cloth
which had been given him, and in a few moments
the red and white colors were waving gently in the
light breeze.</p>
<p>Joe Fisher, who was now able to walk about, although
his arm was still in a sling, chanced to be
on the bastion. Gazing carelessly toward the big
tree, as he had done many times before without discovering
anything, and without really expecting to
see anything unusual this time, he was astonished
at beholding the bits of cloth waving in the air. Then
he ran down the wall, and across the parade to the
captain&rsquo;s quarters. Bursting unceremoniously into
the officer&rsquo;s presence, he exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, Late is alive, and has escaped from the
red-coats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; the commander asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are signals on the tree. It is the
red and the white, which means that the Indians are
deserting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; admitted the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and
see for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man and boy soon stood on the bastion looking
across the river, and while they gazed the red cloth
was drawn in, and the white left alone to toss in the
gentle wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reinforcements are comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; shouted Joe in his
excitement. &ldquo;Reinforcements are comin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words rang through the garrison, and in an
instant came back in answer a mighty cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The signals are changing again, captain,&rdquo; the lad
cried. &ldquo;See! Late has put the black beside the
white. It means that the red-coats are makin&rsquo; ready
to run away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we&rsquo;ll give them something to run
from,&rdquo; Captain Swartwout declared, and immediately
issued orders for all his force, save fifty men, to prepare
for a sally.</p>
<p>But before the little army could be made ready,
Colonel St. Leger was on the move. Rendered uneasy
by the desertion of his allies, alarmed by the tidings
contained in the letter which had reached him so
mysteriously, he lost hope when a Tory came into
camp with the report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Schuyler and his whole army are only a
few miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Britisher gave orders to raise the siege. The
cheers of the soldiers in the Yankee fort quickened
his movements, and when the so-called rebels rushed
out from the great gate, he and his regulars were on
the run.</p>
<p>Reasoning that the small force in the garrison
would not dare to make a sally unless reinforcements
were close at hand, St. Leger did not even stop to
skirmish with his pursuers; but hastened toward
Oswego at a pace which soon forced the daring patriots
to abandon the chase. When Colonel Arnold
and his twelve hundred men arrived a few hours
later, there was no foe to fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>But some time before the gallant colonel appeared,
Ira Le Geyt, Late Wentworth, and Joe Fisher were
comparing notes and telling their experiences under
the walls of the fort. When the latter heard of the
victory at Bennington, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if General Burgoyne&rsquo;s left wing was
clipped at Bennington, he has lost his entire right
wing here at Fort Stanwix.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE OLD HUT.</span></h2>
<p>When Colonel St. Leger abandoned the siege at
Fort Stanwix, he left behind him two very angry
men. One was old David Daggett, and the other
Hiram Le Geyt. The former, cherishing his hatred
for Latham Wentworth, had tried to keep informed
of his fate; but the Indians who held him captive
were, for some reason, very reticent about what they
were going to do with the lad. So it happened the
old Tory did not learn that the young scout had been
condemned to the stake, until the afternoon of the proposed
torture. He hurried toward the scene; but
gained the bank of the river just in time to meet the
band of yelling Indians in full flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Unable to speak their language, he could make
out but little regarding the reason for flight; but
turned and followed them to their encampment.
There he met a brave who could speak a little English,
and succeeded in learning that a white man,
with an iron cross, had suddenly appeared, telling
the Indians that there was no time for their cruel
sport, because a great army of Yankees were near at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Ira!&rdquo; he cried, and retraced his steps
to the stream, expecting to meet his grandson on the
way. Disappointed in this, he crossed the river to
the scene of the death dance. There was the tree
that had been used as a stake, the scattered wood, the
severed cords, but no prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who it was,&rdquo; he muttered, after carefully
examining the clearing. &ldquo;It was that other young
devil, Joe Fisher. He not only in some way learned
about Ira&rsquo;s cross; but has got one in imitation of it,
and just fooled those redskins to rescue the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his rage he hurried back to Colonel St. Leger&rsquo;s
tent with the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skilful trick,&rdquo; was the only comment of that
officer, who, now that his anger had cooled, was
secretly glad the young scout had been saved from
a terrible death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to send out men to find and make
certain both are burned at the stake,&rdquo; Master Daggett
growled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my friend,&rdquo; the colonel replied, becoming
tired of the constant interference of his guest,
&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you search for them? When you have
located the lads, I&rsquo;ll give you as many men as may
be needed to capture them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A capital suggestion, colonel,&rdquo; the half-crazy
man cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. Good luck to you, as well
as to myself,&rdquo; and he hurried away to the tent he
shared with his son-in-law.</p>
<p>Hiram Le Geyt was within, and listened eagerly
to the story his father-in-law poured forth while making
ready for the tramp. He took the same view of
Late Wentworth&rsquo;s rescue that the older Tory had;
but it suggested to him two possibilities which had
not entered the former&rsquo;s mind. Had something happened
to his son, and the talisman fallen into rebel
hands? The question awakened his fears, and he
decided to visit Burgoyne&rsquo;s camp at the first opportunity.
Then again, might not the announcement of
an approaching army of rebels so fill the Indians with
alarm, that they would desert Colonel St. Leger,
leaving him with a force too small to cope with the
Yankees?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Like his son Ira, he was familiar with the language
of the savages, and, leaving his father-in-law to follow
out his own whims, he hastened to the encampment
of the dusky allies. He found that the tidings of a
coming army had already spread among the savages
like wild-fire, and although none had yet started for
their villages, there was an uneasiness among the
entire company which betokened grave disaster.</p>
<p>Doing what he could to allay the fears among the
braves, he learned some facts which greatly mystified
him. The description which the warriors gave of
the person who had so suddenly come among them,
did not accord with the ideas he had formed of young
Fisher&rsquo;s appearance, while what the Indians had to
say about the man who had given them the friendly
warning, did tally well with the likeness of his own
son. Could it be that his father-in-law had made a
mistake? If so, why had Ira set the captive free?
Where had he gone? Was the report of a great force,
coming to the rescue of the fort correct? Perplexed
by the many questions which were crowding into his
mind, he turned abruptly on his heel and went back
to the British camp to talk the matter over with
Colonel St. Leger. He found the officer so little disturbed
by the strange occurrence that he was angered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it was a Yankee trick to scare away that
squad of savages and save the youngster,&rdquo; the colonel
remarked, &ldquo;it has been a success, and we can
afford to laugh because it was so cleverly done. If
it was indeed your son, he will in due time present
himself here. Meantime we can afford to await his
coming, for I put no faith in the belief that the Indians
will run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel St. Leger changed his mind, however, the
next day, for he had barely eaten breakfast before
a messenger arrived announcing that during the night
two bands of his allies, numbering over a hundred,
had left the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll send an
officer to bring them back, and a little later will call
the head men into consultation. Surely there cannot
be very much alarm come from an idle rumor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later he received another shock. A young
brave appeared bringing a sealed note, addressed to
himself. Tearing it open he read the few lines, noted
the signature of General Burgoyne, with which he
was familiar, and then demanded of the waiting Indian
where he had got the missive. As best he could
in broken English, the savage told the story. It was
not plain to the officer, and he sent for Hiram Le
Geyt to act as interpreter. Then the facts came out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>A chief, wounded at Oriskany, had, assisted by a
white stranger with an iron cross, crawled into the
encampment, but soon died from exposure and suffering.
While preparing him for burial the message
had been found on his body. When shown to
the white man he knew nothing about it; but, after
looking it over, said it was for the British commander,
therefore he, the messenger, had brought it. The
explanation involved so much of mystery that the
colonel asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this white man still in the encampment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was when I left it,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him here,&rdquo; was the command, and it was
a stupid mistake on the part of the officer. Had he
sent an orderly, the latter would doubtless have found
and brought in the strange visitor. As it was, the
warrior, when he found Ira, was easily persuaded
that the lad could go to the commander alone, and he
did not do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the colonel and his friend discussed the
genuineness of the message. The former, perhaps
because its contents gave him a chance to withdraw
gracefully from an unpleasant situation, was firm in
the belief that his chief had sent the letter. Hiram
Le Geyt felt positive the note was a skilful forgery,
designed by the rebels to frighten the officer into an
abandonment of the siege.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is absurd to think the general would send you
such a message except through the regular channel,
an accredited courier,&rdquo; the Tory declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have done so,&rdquo; the officer retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is he? Why don&rsquo;t he appear?&rdquo; demanded
Master Le Geyt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is dead, injured, or captured,&rdquo; replied
the colonel calmly. &ldquo;Finding he could not
deliver it himself, he gave it to the wounded chief,
who crawled miles, sacrificed his life, in fact, that
he might place it in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty theory, but one no sane man would
accept,&rdquo; the Tory cried angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your belief?&rdquo; asked Colonel St. Leger,
growing cool as his companion grew angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the white man who helped the redskin into
his camp hid the letter on the dead body, a much more
sensible view than your own,&rdquo; sneered the Tory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon know who is right. It cannot be
long now before the fellow is here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>They waited an hour, and then an orderly was
sent to the encampment to learn the reason for the
long delay. He returned with the word that the
white stranger could not be found, and that the Indians
were rapidly deserting.</p>
<p>During the entire day efforts were made to hold
the Indians; but with only partial success. After
nightfall the red-men departed in such numbers
that barely an hundred were left at dawn. Then
came the Tory with his startling news that General
Schuyler&rsquo;s entire army was close at hand, and Colonel
St. Leger gave orders to abandon the siege.</p>
<p>In vain Hiram Le Geyt and David Daggett, who
had now returned, argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am obeying the orders of my superior,&rdquo; Colonel
St. Leger declared stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are false,&rdquo; both Tories cried in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must permit me to be my own judge,&rdquo; was
the withering reply.</p>
<p>Cheers from the Yankee fort interrupted the conversation,
and when the sally was made, the angry
Tories were themselves forced to flee. But, as soon
as possible, they left the retreating army, and turned
their faces toward home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Compelled to make a long detour because of Colonel
Arnold&rsquo;s forces, they could not decide as to the
number of soldiers, and were not certain but that
the entire army of the north was advancing to
strengthen the fort. For the first time they also were
compelled to acknowledge that there might be some
truth in the message which had so mysteriously come
into the hands of the British colonel.</p>
<p>Once at home, Hiram Le Geyt discussed with his
wife the incidents connected with the use of the iron
cross by the white lad, and while she agreed with
him that Joe Fisher and the stranger were probably
one and the same, yet she was fearful that it betokened
some misfortune to her son. She urged him
to visit Burgoyne&rsquo;s headquarters immediately, and,
therefore, on the morning following his arrival at the
farm, he and his father-in-law embarked in a canoe
to journey down the river.</p>
<p>Soon after Colonel Arnold arrived at Fort Stanwix,
the three young scouts set out on their return
to the Hudson. They traveled on foot, taking the
nearest way through the valley. Arriving at Little
Falls, they spent the night at the house of a well-known
patriot, and early next morning resumed their
tramp. As they passed the lane leading to the Le
Geyt farm, Late asked Ira if he was going to stop
and see his &ldquo;mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she wouldn&rsquo;t be glad to see me,&rdquo; he
replied with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Hiram and David have come home
yet?&rdquo; Joe added, &ldquo;or if they are still with St
Leger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t run any risk to find out,&rdquo; Ira declared.
&ldquo;You waste words, lads, for dear as the old place is
to me, I am not going to stop there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed and went on, little dreaming that
at about the same time the men of whom they had
been speaking were setting off down the Mohawk.
Toward evening the coming of a severe thunder storm
forced them to seek a shelter of some kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an old hut not far away,&rdquo; Ira said.
&ldquo;I spent a night there on my way to the fort. It
is in fairly good repair, and will give us decent refuge
from the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking he had turned into the woods, and
was followed by the other lads. A short walk brought
them to the cabin, and just in time, for hardly were
they inside when the rain began to fall.</p>
<p>It was not a terrific storm, and soon resolved into
a steady down-pour of rain, which caused the young
travelers to be thankful for so good a shelter. They
ate supper from the contents of their packs, and swept
a corner of the room, intending to make their beds
on the hard floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Before lying down, however, Late made ready to
close the door against any chance intruders; but he
stepped back quickly, exclaiming in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Daggett and some other men are comin&rsquo;!
Hark! don&rsquo;t you hear their voices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comrades listened a moment, and Ira said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! we must get into the loft!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant he had climbed up the rude pole
to the floor above. Joe followed, while Late delayed
only long enough to throw up their guns and traps,
after which he also ascended. Pulling the pole up
after him, he covered the opening with a sort of trapdoor,
and none too soon, for in another minute the
old Tory entered the cabin accompanied by three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel in your pocket, Hiram, and see if your
flint and steel are handy,&rdquo; Master Daggett said. &ldquo;If
there&rsquo;s any wood here, we&rsquo;ll build a fire to dry our
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; a strange voice
replied. &ldquo;I have mine handy, and am sure there
is enough stuff for a little blaze. Or there was the
last time I looked in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boys saw through the crevices of the
floor the glare of a tiny flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have it,&rdquo; the same man added, &ldquo;and here is
the wood. Soon there&rsquo;ll be fire enough to dry us
within as well as without,&rdquo; and he laughed at his
own attempt to be witty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate we were to meet you, Captain
Brant,&rdquo; Hiram Le Geyt now said; &ldquo;but for you we
shouldn&rsquo;t have known of this shelter. But who is
your companion? You have not introduced him to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had the time. When our canoes
crashed into each other and sank, it was all we could
do to look out for ourselves, and while running for
the cabin there was no chance for introductions. But
I am now glad to present him to you. Hiram Le Geyt,
this is Alexander Turnbull; Master Daggett, Master
Turnbull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the men below were acknowledging the introduction
and greeting each other heartily, the lads
above strove to get a view of the famous Mohawk
chieftain, and the no less famous British spy, who
had so many times escaped capture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The blazing fire below gave them a full view of
both men. Brant, a stalwart Indian in civilized dress,
and speaking English fluently;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
Turnbull, a little
man, almost womanly in appearance, and yet known
to be brave with a facility for assuming disguises
which so far had never been detected.</p>
<p>The boys would have been glad to talk with each
other just then, but prudence forced them to remain
silent, and, therefore, gave their undivided attention
to the conversation which followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from below, captain?&rdquo; Hiram Le Geyt
asked, as he was wringing the rain from his garments
that he might spread them in front of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Indian answered. &ldquo;I was not pleased
with St. Leger&rsquo;s movements at Oriskany, and went
down to meet Burgoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what result?&rdquo; the Tory asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sustains me; gives me a colonel&rsquo;s commission,
and hereafter I am to have a voice in all campaigns
where I and my men serve as allies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t help you any,&rdquo; the Tory said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because St. Leger is already on his way back to
Quebec,&rdquo; was Master Le Geyt&rsquo;s reply, and he rapidly
detailed the events which had led to the Colonel&rsquo;s
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see your son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burgoyne told me he had sent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger Tory was silent for a minute or two,
and then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, what do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it,&rdquo; the old man gasped.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he make himself known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brandt answered bluntly, &ldquo;unless
it was a freak, such as you have sometimes
shown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of being offended, the old Tory laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram would hate to admit the boy was anything
like me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the captain went on, &ldquo;Burgoyne speaks
in the highest terms of the lad&rsquo;s services, of his loyalty,
his fidelity, and ability. When he returned from
Bennington, where the general sent him to spy out
the land, he brought with him a list of all the stores,
and of every farm in the vicinity where cattle and
horses could be found. I saw it myself, and told the
general if he had given Ira command of the forces,
instead of Baum, he&rsquo;d have brought everything back
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Baum do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Allowed his force to be crushed, or nearly so.
With St. Leger&rsquo;s retreat Burgoyne will feel that he is
left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the Hudson making ready to advance on
the rebels who are entrenched at Bemis Heights.
Now that the colonel has retreated I shall get together
my men and go to his help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the outlook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brant was silent for some time, as if thinking the
situation over, then said frankly: &ldquo;I cannot tell.
Now that the rebels have a new commander, I believe
Burgoyne has fair chance of success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new rebel commander?&rdquo; cried David Daggett.
&ldquo;What has become of old Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been removed, and a man named Gates,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
from New England, put in his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Removed for what?&rdquo; interrupted Hiram Le
Geyt.</p>
<p>The Indian laughed. &ldquo;It is a long story. Master
Turnbull will tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>To say that the three scouts in the loft were amazed
at this revelation, is a mild statement. Even in the
darkness they gazed at each other with an intensity
which could be felt if not seen. Then, with ears
strained to catch every word, they listened to the tale
of the spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been my latest work,&rdquo; Turnbull began,
&ldquo;and one I am proud of. We may as well admit
what we all know, that Schuyler is the ablest man
the rebels could have chosen for this northern campaign.
Too able, as many of us who were watching
the movements of both armies, soon discovered, and
we decided he must be removed if Burgoyne was
to win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sent into New England, as a good patriot
of course, to stir up a feeling against him, and raise a
clamor for his removal. I claimed that by allowing
St. Clair to abandon Ticonderoga, and by evacuating
Fort Edward, he had left an open gate for the enemy
to pour into the East. I said nothing about his fortifying
Bemis Heights, nor of the skilful way in which
he had maneuvered to delay his opponent until
the latter&rsquo;s stores were exhausted. I dwelt only on
what seemed to be grievous mistakes. And I succeeded,
the clamor was raised, and now the mighty is
fallen. Schuyler is down and out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>The four men discussed the matter for some time,
and all were agreed that the work of Master Turnbull
meant much for the king&rsquo;s cause. Then they
stretched themselves on the floor and slept.</p>
<p>The boys in the loft followed their example, making
as little noise as might be when they laid down on
the rough planks. The heavy rain on the roof did
much to drown the creaking of the timbers and the
heavy breathing of the sleepers.</p>
<p>They were awakened by the singing of David Daggett.
There was not a musical note in the old man&rsquo;s
voice; but he believed there was, and, arising just as
the sun was breaking through the clouds, he threw
open the door and screamed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When I was young, I served the king.</p>
<p class="t0">I thought it was the proper thing.</p>
<p class="t0">When I was old and my hair was gray,</p>
<p class="t0">On the king&rsquo;s side I did stay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He was soon silenced. Captain Brant, and Master
Turnbull, as well as his own son-in-law, were aroused
and striving to shut off the old Tory&rsquo;s clamor by the
threat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop, we&rsquo;ll duck you in the Mohawk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>This commotion enabled the lads to make a change
of position without betraying their presence, and then
they waited until the occupants of the lower room had
eaten and departed.</p>
<p>Just before leaving the younger Tory said to the
older:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, if Ira went up to Fort Stanwix, he will
stop at the farm when he returns. Likely he is there
now, so we may as well go back. I hope, since they
are on their way up the river, that Captain Brant
and Master Turnbull will go with us, to be our guests
for as long a time as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Hiram,&rdquo; the old man replied, and
with such understanding the four friends of the king
left the hut, striking off through the thicket
toward the road that led to Master Le Geyt&rsquo;s
home.</p>
<p>Two minutes later the three scouts had descended
from their hiding-place and were making preparations
for breakfast. While working they talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you, Ira,&rdquo; Late began, &ldquo;that those
Tories decided to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had been outside the hut when those
fellers came,&rdquo; Joe said half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked young Wentworth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might have captured the whole gang,&rdquo; the
former explained. &ldquo;It would have been a great
haul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been glad to put my hands on that
spy,&rdquo; Ira said grimly.</p>
<p>He had hardly more than spoken when the door
was flung open, and Master Turnbull stood before
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">THE REAL IRA.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, lieutenant,&rdquo; he said looking at the
leader of the little party. &ldquo;I think I left my knife
here, and as it is a valuable one, I came back for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no question but that he had heard Ira&rsquo;s
remark, and it was equally evident he knew who the
young scout really was. He must also have understood
how dangerous was his position, yet he spoke
as calmly as if he had suddenly happened upon a
party of friends, rather than enemies.</p>
<p>While Late and Joe stood motionless in bewilderment,
Ira showed himself fully a match, both in coolness
and politeness, for the spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen nothing of the weapon, Master
Turnbull,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but perhaps it is here. Come
in, and we&rsquo;ll help you find it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, lieutenant,&rdquo; the fellow replied as he
entered and advanced to the corner where he had
been sleeping. &ldquo;It should be here,&rdquo; he continued,
stooping down to look for it. &ldquo;Yes, I have it,&rdquo; he
cried a moment later, and came forward holding a
beautiful dagger in his hand. Passing it to Ira, he
asked in a tone of pride:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything finer than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout gazed at it admiringly. The scabbard
was of fine leather, curiously embroidered with
threads of gold. The hilt was silver, and on it the
letters &ldquo;A. T.&rdquo; were engraved within a wreath of
myrtle leaves and flowers; the blade was of finest
steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gift from my lady-love,&rdquo; the owner explained
with a laugh. &ldquo;Do you wonder I valued the toy
enough to come back after it? I carry it in a pocket
in my waistcoat, as an extra weapon for a special
time of need. Somehow it slipped from its hiding-place
last night, and I did not discover it until I
was a half-mile down the trail. Return it to me,
please, and I will rejoin my companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weapon you may have,&rdquo; Ira replied, passing
it back to Turnbull; &ldquo;but I must insist that you
stay to breakfast with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shrug of his shoulders the spy replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must, if you insist upon it, lieutenant,&rdquo;
and he quietly seated himself upon a short log
which served as stool and awaited the pleasure of his
hosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late, take your rifle and keep watch against the
return of the Indian or Tories, while the rest of us
eat,&rdquo; the young scout commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not trouble yourself to do that,&rdquo; Master
Turnbull explained. &ldquo;I told my friends to go on,
and I would overtake them. It will be an hour or two
before they think it worth while to turn back for the
purpose of hunting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt your word, sir,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;but we will run no risk of either surprise or capture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exercising your usual caution, lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;but
I will not speak the other name, for it may be you do
not care to have even your comrades know it. Had I
been as careful, however, I would not now be in your
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world didn&rsquo;t you run away as soon as
you caught sight of us?&rdquo; Joe asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I preferred to be captured rather than
lose my knife,&rdquo; the spy explained with a smile.
&ldquo;That may seem queer now; but you will understand
it later on in life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I get a sweetheart, I s&rsquo;pose you mean,&rdquo;
the lad replied, with a grin. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s lucky for us
you&rsquo;ve got one,&rdquo; and he turned his attention to the
food.</p>
<p>When he had finished the meal he changed places
with Latham, while Ira sat with his eyes fixed upon
the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more I think the matter over,&rdquo; Master Turnbull
said after a brief silence, &ldquo;the surer I am, lieutenant,
that you have adopted my trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sowed no seed of discord against General
Burgoyne,&rdquo; Ira replied in a meaning tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you would have done it had such a step
been possible, or necessary to your purpose. You
know the old saying that &lsquo;Everything is fair in love
and war?&rsquo;&rdquo; was the smiling reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I presume so,&rdquo; Ira said slowly; &ldquo;but it
comes a trifle harder to admit it in this case, than in
some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the man replied with a show of
sympathy; &ldquo;but you have this to console you, that
every charge made against the general was false.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is something I readily acknowledge,&rdquo; the
lad said with a laugh; &ldquo;but you are a dangerous
fellow to be at liberty, Master Turnbull, and I shall
be doing the Cause great service if I see that you
are put where it is no longer possible to do any
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known you would take that view of
it,&rdquo; the spy said gloomily, &ldquo;and yet I have a proposition
to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you had taken up my trade,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;for I venture to guess you have been up country as
Ira Le Geyt. You steered clear of Colonel St. Leger&rsquo;s
headquarters, knowing there were those near-by who
would recognize you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira&rsquo;s reply was a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture more,&rdquo; the speaker continued. &ldquo;It is
that you have been the Ira Le Geyt who for weeks
has been a close adviser of General Burgoyne. How
you have brought it about, lieutenant, I don&rsquo;t know.
Where the real Ira is I cannot say. But, if the disasters
that have befallen my general are due to you, the
injury you have done the king is greater than any I
have worked against the colonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the scout replied. &ldquo;That is no
mean compliment, coming from one who has been so
uniformly successful in his work as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see we understand each other,&rdquo; the spy added.
&ldquo;Your work has offset mine. Why not continue to
let it do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go now, and I give my word of honor that
I will in no way betray you, either to the men I have
just left, or to the general. In other words, you may
go on in your work unmolested by me, if you allow
me to continue mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can afford to make such an offer,&rdquo; Ira said
with a smile. &ldquo;I have you where I can put an end
to all your work. More than that even, for once I
deliver you into the hands of our commander, your life
is not worth a farthing. What gain have I personally
in releasing you? I can continue the work I am
doing more successfully with you in our hands, than
at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be so sure of that,&rdquo; the spy returned
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will run the risk anyway,&rdquo; the scout answered
decisively. &ldquo;You must go with us,&rdquo; and ten minutes
later the three lads and their prisoner were moving
rapidly down the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Not until they were twenty-five miles below the old
hut, did the little party go into camp. A rude shack
was the only shelter, and in this the prisoner and two
of the scouts were soon sleeping. It fell to Late&rsquo;s lot
to stand the first watch. His time of guard duty had
nearly expired when he heard the spy moving restlessly.
Going quickly to his side, the lad found Turnbull
sitting upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have a talk with you,&rdquo; the man said
in a low tone. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come outside? I don&rsquo;t want
to awaken your comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering what the fellow had in mind; but
believing himself capable of caring for him, Late said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! Come on! But understand that if
you attempt to run away I&rsquo;ll let daylight through
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Turnbull made no reply to the threat; but,
rising, followed Late into the open air. It was starlight,
not very dark, and quite warm. Sitting on a
rock, a rod or two from the shack, the prisoner began
to fan himself with his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to get into the fresh
air. It was so hot in there, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you&rsquo;ll go back faster than you came
out, if you don&rsquo;t hurry up an&rsquo; tell me what&rsquo;s on your
mind,&rdquo; Late growled, beginning to grow suspicious of
the fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get away,&rdquo; he said, coming immediately
to the subject in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; the lad retorted. &ldquo;I should
if I was in your place,&rdquo; and he changed the position
of his gun as token that he was not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>The captive noted the movement, but was not disconcerted
by it. &ldquo;I can make it an object for you to
go to sleep, and let me steal away,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me that dagger?&rdquo; Late asked,
although, as he afterward explained to his companions,
&ldquo;I was mad enough inside to bite the rascal&rsquo;s head
off. To think the fool thought he could bribe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; the prisoner replied;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll give you this,&rdquo; and he drew a purse from
his pocket, shaking it so that Late could hear the clink
of the gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much is that?&rdquo; the lad asked, with well-feigned
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, they are all sovereigns,&rdquo; Master Turnbull
said, opening the purse and dropping the coins into
his hat one by one. &ldquo;Ten,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;More money
than you are ever likely to have again, and it&rsquo;s all
yours if you&rsquo;ll only be careless enough to let me get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Careless &rsquo;nough to let you get away,&rdquo; the young
scout repeated in a voice loud enough to awaken his
comrades. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you I&rsquo;m not to be bought,
you old fool, at any price,&rdquo; and he advanced angrily
toward the spy with gun upraised, as if to strike him
down.</p>
<p>But before he could do so Turnbull leaped to his
feet and made a dash for the nearest tree, evidently
hoping to get that between himself and his guard, and
so effect his escape. But he was not quick enough.
Bringing his rifle to his shoulder, Late fired, and the
fugitive fell headlong to the ground. In another
moment all three lads were bending over what appeared
to be a lifeless body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a torch,&rdquo; Ira cried, thrusting his hand beneath
the unconscious man&rsquo;s shirt.</p>
<p>When Joe came with a light, he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not dead. His heart still beats. Help me,
Late, and we&rsquo;ll take him to the shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently they carried him to the shelter, and made
careful search for the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is on the back of his head,&rdquo; Joe cried,
holding the torch so that his companions might see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bullet has not shattered the bones,&rdquo; Ira said
a moment later. &ldquo;It was a glancing shot. He is
only stunned. Bring some water, Late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>They bathed the prisoner&rsquo;s temples; forced liquid
between his lips; washed and bandaged the wound.
When this had been done the man opened his
eyes, and, looking up into their faces, smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; he said feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; Late replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I had to do
it; but you shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
of the right stuff even if you are a rebel. But I ought
to have known as much. Your leader don&rsquo;t select any
other kind of men to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short time he sank into a troubled sleep,
and, leaving Joe to watch him, Ira and Late also laid
down. A few hours later the former changed places
with the watcher, and thus the night passed. At dawn
the wounded man showed signs of fever, and was unable
to walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Late asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a litter and carry him,&rdquo; Ira replied. &ldquo;He
must be taken where he&rsquo;ll have better care than we
can give him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late and Joe hurried off to get material for a
stretcher; but a moment later the latter came hurriedly
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have found a canoe that was hidden in a
thicket on the river bank,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Late is putting
it into the water, and will then come to help you carry
Master Turnbull. I would take hold, but don&rsquo;t
believe my right arm is strong enough yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; his comrade said with decision; &ldquo;but
you can carry our guns and other traps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late returned speedily, and slowly he and Ira
carried the prisoner to the stream. Fortunately the
boat was large enough to carry them all, and embarking,
they sailed rapidly down the current, escaping
only by a few minutes five horsemen who rode
along the river bank in search of them.</p>
<p>One of the riders leaped from his animal and
examined the ground near the river carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make out, captain?&rdquo; one of his
companions asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows found a canoe in those bushes, and,
putting the wounded man in it, have gone down the
stream,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can head them off,&rdquo; his comrade cried.
&ldquo;The river makes a bend a few miles below. By
riding straight across the neck we should be able to cut
them off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; was the reply, and when the captain had
remounted his horse, all hastened back to the trail.
Gaining it, they put spurs to their steeds and galloped
off in pursuit of their prey. Three hours later they
were near the river again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be ahead of the rebels,&rdquo; the former
spokesman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, Hiram,&rdquo; the eldest of the party
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they come,&rdquo; Captain Brant cried five
minutes later, pointing to the bow of a canoe which
was just coming into view. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hitch our horses
and be ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismounting, they secured the animals behind a
clump of trees, and then crept cautiously along to the
edge of the river, concealing themselves behind some
rocks.</p>
<p>Ignorant of the ambuscade, the occupants of the
light craft paddled rapidly on. They had made good
progress, and in another hour would arrive at a settlement
where they could secure the aid the wounded
man needed. For some reason, however, which they
could not themselves explain, they hugged the south
bank, and the river at that point was quite wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Suddenly one of the hidden horses broke its halter
and ran wildly through the woods, startling the other
animals until they neighed loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a squad of horsemen over there,&rdquo;
Ira cried. &ldquo;Quick! pull under cover of the right
bank until we can look about us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late obeyed hurriedly, and the canoe was turned
toward the shore.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack! Crack! came the reports of three
rifles, and the bullets struck the water behind, ahead,
and below the craft.</p>
<p>Then she glided under the cover of the overhanging
trees, but as she disappeared two more shots were
fired from the ambush, a ball struck the prisoner, who
had raised himself to learn the cause of the firing, in
the breast, killing him instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; Joe exclaimed, catching the spy
in his arms as he sank slowly back into the bow of
the boat.</p>
<p>These words were heard on the opposite shore, and
immediately old David Daggett leaped upon the rock
behind which he had been concealed. Swinging his
hat above his head, he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;ve killed one of them! We&rsquo;ve
killed one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Late seized his rifle and fired at the old man,
muttering as he did so:	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you, you old
Tory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His bullet, however, struck, not the old, but the
younger Tory, Hiram Le Geyt, who at that moment
had sprung up to pull his father-in-law down behind
the barricade.</p>
<p>The occupants of the canoe could not tell whether
he was killed, or only wounded. But they heard Captain
Brant&rsquo;s voice directing two negroes to carry their
master into the woods where he would be out of range
of the flying bullets. Then Ira, without exposing himself,
called to the Indian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Brant, one of your shots struck our prisoner,
who was only slightly wounded, in the breast,
killing him instantly. We will leave his body, and
everything that belongs to him, in the canoe. You
may take possession of the craft at any time. We will
not disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he and his comrades, after securing the boat
to the nearest tree, leaped ashore and entered the
forest. Before they were out of hearing, however, the
reply of the Mohawk chief could be heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, lads! I&rsquo;ll care for him as soon as I can
leave my friend here, who is, I fear mortally
wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;That hardly sounds like the bloodiest chieftain in
the valley,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
does it?&rdquo; Ira said, as he and his companions
hastened along. &ldquo;Even he seems to appreciate
a thoughtful act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When opposite the next settlement, they called to
a lad who was fishing in the river, and he, coming
across in a boat, ferried them over. There they
passed the night, and on the following morning
hastened on down the valley.</p>
<p>As they advanced Joe referred to the change in the
commanders of the Continental forces, asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you report to this General Gates, Ira, the
same as you did to General Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He is now in General
Schuyler&rsquo;s place, and should be treated precisely
as was our former leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Late and I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; he objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But it will be
easy to fix all that. You will find General Schuyler,
even though he has been relieved of command, in the
camp, doing all he can for the Cause which is dearer
to him than life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t many men who would do that,&rdquo; Late interrupted.
&ldquo;Do you remember how it was with Colonel
Stark? When he thought he had been misused,
he surrendered his commission and went back to his
farm in New Hampshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he responded to the call from Bennington,&rdquo;
Ira replied, &ldquo;and, recognizing his mistake, will now
go back to the regular army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our general don&rsquo;t make such mistakes,&rdquo; cried
Joe in tones of admiration. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s large enough to
overlook any personal slight, for the good of the
Cause. Some day the people of the colonies will know
the truth, and count him one of their heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Ira said with glistening eyes.
&ldquo;May we all live to see your prophecy come
true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At sunset they were in the vicinity of Bemis
Heights, and had no difficulty in locating the British
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lads, we&rsquo;ll part here,&rdquo; Ira said. &ldquo;You
will find Dan with our army, and after you have reported
to the general, he will show you the place I
have chosen as our rendezvous on this side the Hudson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;But is it safe now for you to enter the British
lines?&rdquo; Late asked anxiously. &ldquo;What if David Daggett
should show up there within a few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll hardly arrive as soon as that,&rdquo; was the quiet
reply, &ldquo;though doubtless he will appear later. Meantime
I have the opportunity to report to General Burgoyne,
and learn the present condition of his forces.
It will probably be the last work I shall do as Ira
Le Geyt,&rdquo; and he left them.</p>
<p>Before they gained the entrenchments of the Continentals,
the two boys met Dan Cushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Ira?&rdquo; was his first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone into the British encampment,&rdquo; they explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought not have gone there!&rdquo; Dan cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause General Gates has let the real Ira go; an&rsquo;
also set free that courier, George Preston,&rdquo; was the
startling announcement. &ldquo;General Schuyler, soon as
he heard of it, sent me to meet you an&rsquo; stop Ira.
Those fellers will make straight for Burgoyne&rsquo;s headquarters,
an&rsquo; get thar &rsquo;fore our Ira does. It means
they&rsquo;ll hang him soon as he shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments his hearers stood as though
stupefied, and then Late gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do,&rdquo; Dan said
stoutly. &ldquo;I shall follow Ira into the British lines,
if necessary, to save him, or hang with him,&rdquo; and
he walked away toward the enemy&rsquo;s encampment.</p>
<p>There was need for him, or some other friend, to
take such an heroic step, for before he had gained the
nearest British picket post, the young scout was in
General Burgoyne&rsquo;s tent, face to face with the real Ira
Le Geyt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE MIDNIGHT FIRE.</span></h2>
<p>Confident that he had ample time to report Colonel
St. Leger&rsquo;s flight to his superior, and learn when
and how that officer intended to engage the Continentals,
before any of his enemies could disclose his
identity, Ira, after parting with his lieutenants,
walked rapidly on to the nearest picket-post of the
British camp.</p>
<p>Here his first trouble began. In no way could he
convince the sentinel that he had a right to pass
through the lines. The fellow was a Hessian, who
could not read, and the scout&rsquo;s paper, written both
in English and German, directing that he be allowed
to go in or out of the camp at all times, was of no
avail. Therefore the captain of the guard had to be
summoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>He knew Ira, and permitted him to pass the picket,
but, to the surprise of the lad, held him up at the
guard tent until his arrival could be made known to
the commander of that division, General Fraser. At
length an order came for him to be allowed to report
to the commander-in-chief, and he went on, believing
it was the nearness of the enemy that had caused this
unusual caution on the part of the British officers.</p>
<p>When he finally reached General Burgoyne, that
officer, instead of greeting him with his usual warmth,
merely nodded towards a camp stool, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Master Le Geyt, I will hear your
report in a short time,&rdquo; and then he left the tent, remaining
away at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>On his return he gazed searchingly at the scout for
an instant, and then, with an apparent effort to control
himself, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to listen to anything you have to tell
me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner convinced the lad that something was
wrong; but he was there and must speak, therefore,
acting as if he suspected nothing amiss, he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, General Burgoyne, that you have
heard of the battle of Oriskany through Captain
Brant, therefore know of its outcome, and I need not
dwell upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer merely bowed assent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ill-feeling created there,&rdquo; Ira continued,
&ldquo;soon showed itself throughout the Indian encampment,
so that when I first visited it some of the warriors
had departed, and before I came away a bare
hundred of the original force remained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you said nothing to hasten their departure?&rdquo;
the general inquired pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only told them that large reinforcements were
on the way to strengthen the fort, which was true, sir.
I passed Colonel Arnold with twelve hundred men as
I went up country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes a difference sometimes how even the
truth is told,&rdquo; the commander said, and again he gave
the scout a searching glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the lad admitted; &ldquo;but to continue my
report, Colonel St. Leger, finding himself deserted by
his allies, and unable to stand against the Continental
reinforcements, decided to abandon the siege. Retreating
to Oswego, he has sailed for Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; screamed General Burgoyne, and it was
evident there was dismay in his tones. &ldquo;St. Leger
gone without any order from me? Without sending
to me for a force sufficient to meet the rebels? Are
you certain, sir, that you are telling me the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira flushed a trifle; but answered gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I have said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>For the third time the commander gazed fixedly at
his visitor, and then remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few questions to ask you, Master Le
Geyt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no little misgivings the lad replied simply:
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not tell me that you conducted the
courier, George Preston, to Master James Graham&rsquo;s
in safety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the question was asked the lad knew that
in some way the officer had obtained an inkling of his
real character. There was nothing to do but brave it
out, therefore he replied promptly: &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then did you tell me?&rdquo; thundered the enraged
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reported that I had made the journey, and left
the courier in safe hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; the general cried, pushing a letter
towards him. It was on a single sheet, and the words
were written plainly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;General Burgoyne, Honored Sir: <span class="hst">I</span> write this
to make known to you the real character of your
scout called Ira Le Geyt. He is a rebel. He delivered
me into the hands of the rebels, and I have been
imprisoned by them for weeks. But they did not
find the papers I carried, and when this reaches you
I shall be on my way down the river to deliver them.
I trust it may be in time to secure the aid you desire.
The bearer of this will tell you more about the young
man. For the King,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">George Preston</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pray tell me, are those statements true?&rdquo; the general
asked sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man need incriminate himself,&rdquo; Ira replied
with a pale but resolute face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Howell declares that he saw you on
Sugar Loaf Mountain the night the guns were spiked,
and that he has reason to believe you guided him to
the place where the dam was built, using information
he gave you to accomplish that purpose. Have you
any answer to make to these charges?&rdquo; the general
demanded.</p>
<p>The scout remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far you are responsible for the defeat of
Baum at Bennington, and the flight of St. Leger,
which you now report, I probably shall never know.
But one thing is certain, sir. I have facts enough to
hang you,&rdquo; and the enraged officer looked at the scout
as if it would be a pleasure to do it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The lad returned the look without a token of fear;
but made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly you think I do not know who you are,&rdquo;
General Burgoyne continued after a moment; &ldquo;but
wait,&rdquo; he stepped to the door of the tent and spoke to
some one who was evidently standing there to be summoned.</p>
<p>The false Ira arose to find himself face to face
with the real Ira Le Geyt. On one face there was a
smile; on the other a frown. The look one gave said:
&ldquo;I will kill you&rdquo;; the look the other bestowed, said:
&ldquo;You cannot do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a full minute the two stood there. Then
the real Ira spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that cross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Without a word the young scout drew it from his
bosom and, unfastening its chain from his neck,
handed it to the rightful owner. He pulled it apart,
and taking a tiny paper from the hollow tube, passed
it to the general, who read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Fort Edward</span>, June 1, 1777.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To all officers of the Northern Army:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to certify that the bearer of this paper is
Lieutenant Philip Schuyler Jr., my son. He will
personate the Tory, Ira Le Geyt, at the headquarters
of General Burgoyne. You may rely upon all information
he sends you.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;(Signed) <span class="hst"><span class="sc">Philip Schuyler</span>,</span></span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;General Commanding.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before any other could speak, the young Tory, his
eyes flashing, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I have already told you, general. This
fellow, with a squad of soldiers, seized me while I
was crossing the Hudson on my way to meet you at
Lake Champlain, and carried me to Fort Edward,
where I was imprisoned. They took not only papers,
but my entire outfit, including the clothes I had on.
I did not understand why then, but learned later.
When your courier, Master Preston, was thrust into
the dungeon with me, he told me how an Ira Le Geyt,
who was serving as a scout for your army, had betrayed
him into the rebels&rsquo; hands. Then I saw
through the Schuyler plan, and knew that as long as
the son, using my name and wearing my clothes, was
at your headquarters, nothing but disaster would befall
you. I tried desperately to escape. I offered
bribes to the guards; I attempted to tunnel out of the
fort, but failed. When the new commander, Gates,
came, I persuaded him I had been wrongfully confined
for weeks, and he ordered my release. I hastened
here, too late, I fear, to be of any service. But
in justice to myself, I demand that the man who has
deprived me of my rights be properly punished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear about that, Master Le Geyt,&rdquo; the officer
replied with a cruel laugh. &ldquo;Out of justice to
you, and because of injustice to me, this fellow shall
be hanged. I only wish I could string the father up
beside the son. In all my military career I never met
with, or heard of, so infamous a scheme as they have
conceived and carried out. I can see, as you have suggested,
that all the disasters have come through this
young rascal. I will put him under guard to-night.
To-morrow he shall be tried and sentenced. Before
another twenty-four hours have passed, he will be executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called out, and a sergeant with four men entered
and took the prisoner away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Within the stout walls of a log hut, which had been
turned into a temporary prison, Philip (for now he
should be called by his right name) was left to himself.
Naturally he could not avoid dwelling upon
the horrible fate that awaited him, for his conviction
and execution were foregone conclusions. Many a
man had been sent to the gallows by far less evidence
than could be brought against him. In the heart of
the British camp as he was, he might not look for
rescue. There was little hope of escaping through his
own efforts.</p>
<p>He recalled all that he had been able to do, through
the place he had held in the British camp, for the
Cause he loved. The stores at Bennington on which
Burgoyne depended for the sustenance of his army,
had not been secured, and in the attempt to obtain
them that officer had lost a thousand men. The reinforcements
he ardently expected from New York had
not come, and they could not arrive now in time to
save him. St. Leger had been frightened away, and
with him had gone the last hope of the British commander
for any addition to his forces. With his army
weakened, on short rations, and unable to retreat, he
had but one alternative, which was to face a foe that
outnumbered him. From the human point of view
there could be but one outcome, defeat, and with that
defeat all the plans of Lord Germain, the war secretary
in London, would be shattered. Philip was satisfied.
Remembering all he had helped to accomplish,
he could, if necessary, surrender up his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Philip Schuyler was calm when, on the following
day, he faced his accusers. He did not attempt to
deny his identity, or make excuse for a single act. He
did not flinch when he was sentenced to be hanged
twenty-four hours later as a spy. When asked if he
had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced
upon him, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I ran a great risk when I consented to
do the work I have done. I am glad I was permitted
to do so much. I only regret I could not longer have
escaped detection in order to accomplish more. I
shall die happy because I have surrendered my life
for a Cause which I know, and which every one of
you gentlemen knows, to be holy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise he had a visitor during the afternoon.
It was old David Daggett. After assisting
Captain Brant to carry Hiram Le Geyt back to his
home, the old man had again turned his face toward
the Hudson to learn something of his grandson Ira.</p>
<p>Arriving in the camp shortly before noon, he had
found the lad, and heard the story of his imprisonment,
of the false Ira, and of the latter&rsquo;s sentence.
He rubbed his hands in glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see him!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I want to tell
the young devil just what I think of him. I&rsquo;ll stay
until to-morrow to see him die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>To humor him, General Burgoyne gave orders that
the old man be allowed to visit the condemned lad.</p>
<p>There were other prisoners in the guard-house, and
after his sentence the young scout had been carried to
a two-story house used as the barracks for a company
of soldiers. In one of the upper rooms of this he had
been placed in solitary confinement. There was a
guard outside the door, a company of soldiers below,
and sentinels around the building. Every avenue of
escape was supposed to be closed, and the young lieutenant
awaited the hour of his death.</p>
<p>Here David Daggett came. When allowed to enter
the room, he stood for a time gazing at the prisoner,
who arose to meet him, while a smile played on his
lips. Without being invited, he sat in the one chair
the chamber contained, and still stared at the lad.
Then he laughed long and loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just tickles me to see you,&rdquo; he at length said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there about me that pleases you?&rdquo; Philip
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me laugh to think how you will kick
and squirm to-morrow, when the rope is put around
your neck,&rdquo; was the cruel reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>That the captive made no reply, seemed to anger
him. &ldquo;If I had my way you wouldn&rsquo;t hang!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d burn! burn! burn! The Indians
know how to torture their victims, when they kill
them at the stake. I wish you might be scorched to
pay for that fellow you saved at Fort Stanwix. He
ought to have died, and you ought to burn. Every
rebel in the land should be burned. I&rsquo;ll tell the general
to burn you&mdash;&rdquo; and ran from the room.</p>
<p>But when he went to General Burgoyne with his request,
he was told that the sentence of the prisoner
could not be changed. He brooded over the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change it,&rdquo; he muttered, and with a cunning
look in his eyes, he went to the building in which the
prisoner was confined, walking around it again and
again.</p>
<p>The structure had been intended for a shop, with
living-rooms above. At the rear was a small lean-to,
once used as a stable. In this last a large amount
of rubbish had collected. The sharp eyes of the old
man took in all this, and his plan was formed. Late
in the night he slipped out of the tent he occupied
in company with his grandson, and made his way
to the rear of the barracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers can get out,&rdquo; he muttered to himself;
&ldquo;but that young rebel can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll burn him, burn
him up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Into the shanty, unobserved, he crawled. In the
farther corner he pulled some of the most inflammable
material together, and then took out of his pocket his
flint and steel. Into the rubbish the tiny sparks fell.
Slowly the flame grew. He waited until it was under
good headway, and then slipped away to his tent.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed, and then the alarm rang
through the encampment. &ldquo;Fire! Fire! The barracks
are on fire!&rdquo; some one shouted, and others took
up the cry.</p>
<p>Ira Le Geyt awoke and called to his grandfather,
but the old man apparently slept soundly. Not until
having been shaken vigorously did he arouse himself,
and then, rubbing his eyes, he asked innocently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some building is on fire,&rdquo; his grandson explained
and ran out.</p>
<p>David Daggett followed in the direction of the
blaze his hands had kindled. The lean-to was gone;
one side of the house was a mass of flames, and with
an exulting cry on his lips: &ldquo;The rebel will burn!
the rebel will burn!&rdquo; he hastened to join the crowd
that had collected around the doomed building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE DRAWN BATTLE.</span></h2>
<p>Dan Cushing was not to be turned from his purpose
even when he found that his friend had already
entered the British lines. His only question was as
to how he could get there? He had not been seen by
the guard, and, drawing back into the woods, he
walked cautiously along to learn how far it might be
to the next picket. To his delight he discovered that
the sentinels were several rods apart, and each had
been stationed on a ridge, with a small hollow, running
directly up into the encampment, between them. Lying
down in a thicket, he waited.</p>
<p>Slowly the minutes passed. Not until it was dark
did he make a move. Then, as noiselessly as an Indian,
he crept into the hollow, and again paused. No
other sound than the regular tread of the soldiers as
they tramped to and fro on their beat came to his
ears; but both were coming toward him, and, hugging
close to the ground, he remained motionless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>As he suspected, they did not enter the gully, but,
on gaining the opposite banks, called to each other, and
then turned to retrace their steps. Waiting until their
footsteps had nearly died away, he arose and ran
swiftly, but without noise, up to the higher ground.
He was beyond earshot before the guards again
hailed each other, and within the enemy&rsquo;s lines.</p>
<p>Unacquainted with the formation of the camp, it
required some time for him to locate the headquarters
of the commander, and, when he had done
this, he was just in time to see a prisoner in the hands
of four or five soldiers brought forth and hurried to
a log hut. Keeping far enough from the squad to remain
unnoticed, yet near enough to hear the conversation,
he learned beyond all doubt that the arrested
man was his chief.</p>
<p>The arrest of the young scout, and the reason for
it, soon became known in that part of the encampment,
and created no little excitement. It was discussed
in tents and barracks, and even at the guard-house,
therefore it became easy for the lad to ascertain
two facts without in any way attracting attention
to himself. He learned that his friend was to be tried
the next morning as a spy, and that the general
opinion was the trial would be but a form; the condemnation
and execution certain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Perhaps this fact prevented the soldiers from taking
the punishment of the prisoner into their own
hands. Dan, hearing their comments, realized they
were thoroughly angered with the lad who had so completely
hoodwinked officers and men for weeks, thwarting
their purposes and overwhelming them with misfortunes.
But what seemed to anger them more than
all, was the identity of the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that that rebel general sent his own son
into the tent of our commander, and knew all about
his plans before we did, is enough to make the pope
swear,&rdquo; Captain Howell said to a group of officers.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget that the young rascal twice pulled
wool over my eyes, and I&rsquo;d like the privilege of putting
the rope around his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Private as well as officer seemed to entertain much
the same ill-will toward the prisoner, and it was evident
nothing save the assurance that he was to be
summarily dealt with, kept them from taking his
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>After the excitement had subsided somewhat, and
the encampment was comparatively quiet, young
Cushing made as careful an examination of the building
in which his chief was confined as he could and
escape the notice of the sentinels. The conclusion
arrived at, was he could do nothing immediately to
secure the release of his comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might slip back to camp an&rsquo; let the general
know how things are goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;He
may think of some way to help Philip that don&rsquo;t
come into this head of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gained the ravine and was nearly across, when
he heard a sentinel cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you down there? Speak, or I will fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He neither spoke nor stirred.</p>
<p>Bang! went the gun, and the ball whistled so near
his head he could not help dodging. Fortunately he
made no sound, but remained quietly where he was.</p>
<p>Then came rapid footsteps toward the edge of the
opposite bank, and the picket there called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Spencer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some one in the gully, and as he didn&rsquo;t
answer my challenge, I fired,&rdquo; was the explanation.</p>
<p>At that moment the captain of the guard, followed
by a squad of men, came running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you fire?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Spencer told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start the fellow out,&rdquo; the officer said, and,
turning to his men, he ordered them to fire a volley
into the ravine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>They obeyed; but centered their fire on a spot several
yards beyond the lad, and he was not injured.
The bullets dislodged some animal, however, that ran
up the opposite bank, and, scudding by the sentinel
on that side, disappeared in the bushes beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fox,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Spencer mistook a
fox for a man. Ha! ha!&rdquo; and the officer laughed
loudly.</p>
<p>The men on the other bank joined in the mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Spencer declared. &ldquo;It shows I
was looking out so sharply that even a fox could
not escape me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laugh subsided; the squad returned to their
stations; and the pickets resumed their beat.</p>
<p>As soon as they had departed Dan hurried on,
and in a few minutes gained the road leading to
Bemis Heights. Down this he ran until halted by
three hoots of an owl, twice repeated. Stopping suddenly,
he gave the same cry, and after a few seconds
Late and Joe came out from the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are glad to find you at last,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We
have been looking for you half the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to run in with you,&rdquo; he declared, without
asking why they were there. &ldquo;Joe, will you go back
to the fort an&rsquo; tell General Schuyler that our Ira
has been arrested. The Britishers have found out
who he is, an&rsquo; to-morrow mornin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll probably be
condemned an&rsquo; hanged. Whatever we do must be done
quickly. Late, come with me. We won&rsquo;t give up
hope of rescuin&rsquo; him till we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment they had separated, Joe hastening
to the general with his sad tidings, and Dan and
Late hurrying back toward the British camp. Before
gaining the ravine Dan explained how he had
entered the enemy&rsquo;s lines earlier in the night, and
how he hoped to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to move along slow an&rsquo; quiet like,&rdquo;
he added; &ldquo;but I believe it can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was correct, and a half-hour later he and his
comrade emerged from the ravine within the British
lines. To gain the hut in which their friend was
imprisoned was not difficult; but they decided it unwise
to run the risk of being found when dawn came,
therefore the lads looked about for a hiding-place.
Attracted by the lean-to at the rear of the barracks
they crept into it.</p>
<p>In this place of concealment they heard enough of
the soldiers&rsquo; conversation to learn the result of Phillip&rsquo;s
trial, and knew there were yet twenty-four hours
before he would be executed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may be able to do a good bit in that time,&rdquo;
Dan whispered to Late.</p>
<p>They learned also, in the same way, that the prisoner
had been brought to the barracks and put in
solitary confinement in one of its upper rooms. They
also saw David Daggett prowling about the building;
but did not know of his visit upstairs, or of the secret
resolve he had made.</p>
<p>It was nearly dusk when two soldiers met near the
door of the lean-to. One said to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the latest news about the spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger came from the rebel camp under a
flag of truce,&rdquo; the first explained, &ldquo;and wanted to
make an exchange. They offered four men&mdash;a colonel,
two captains, and a lieutenant&mdash;for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did our general say?&rdquo; the other soldier
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Go back and tell your commander I
would not exchange him for your whole army.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I reckon the rebels will understand now
that the young rascal must pay the penalty for his
misdeeds.&rdquo; Then they passed out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that you and I have got to do something,&rdquo;
Dan said to his comrade in a low tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idee,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but will wait
a little later to see whether &rsquo;twill work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour or two passed. Then Dan whispered:
&ldquo;Come, Late,&rdquo; and he led the way out of the building.</p>
<p>Going around to the rear end, he said in the same
low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boost me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That edge of the roof was not more than five feet
from the ground, and, catching hold of it, the lad
waited for his companion to lift him up. In another
instant he was on top the shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hands, Late,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse
whisper, and soon the two were on the roof.</p>
<p>Lying at full length, the lads listened anxiously
for any sound which might betoken that their movements
had been seen. Ten minutes passed, and then
they arose on all fours, creeping up the slanting roof
to where it joined the main building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Just above their heads was an open window. Rising
to their knees they peeped in, only to find themselves
looking into a small, unoccupied room. Laying
his hand upon his comrade in token that he was
to follow, Dan stepped into the chamber, Late joining
him a moment later.</p>
<p>There was no furniture in the room. The young
scouts stretched themselves out on the bare floor, and
again waited. During a long time there was coming
and going about the barracks; then loud conversation
below; but at length all was silent.</p>
<p>Dan went cautiously to the door. Lifting the latch
slowly, he pulled, and without further effort on his
part the door swung open a few inches. Through
the narrow crevice the lad gazed. He could see little;
but the low tread of the sentinel outside of the prisoner&rsquo;s
door reached his ears. Evidently a long
passage was before him, and the soldier was at the
farther end.</p>
<p>Turning to his companion, Dan whispered in his
ear, and then both, removing their boots, went softly
out into the hall. Inch by inch they advanced until
within a few feet of the guard.</p>
<p>Here they waited until he, in his efforts to keep
awake, came down the passage toward them. In
another moment they had seized him as previously
planned, one by the feet, and the other by the throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>There was a struggle; but it was brief and noiseless,
for while one lad choked the fellow, the other
lifted him from the floor. Fortunately he was not
heavy, and could be easily subdued. When the Britisher
had been rendered helpless Late took him in
charge, while Dan examined the door of the room
in which was the prisoner.</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his good fortune when
he found the fastening to be only a piece of iron thrust
through the handle of the latch. Pulling out the bar,
he opened the door and entered. On a narrow bed
against the opposite wall the young lieutenant was
quietly sleeping, but with the first movement of his
rescuer he was aroused, asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; was the cautious reply. &ldquo;Late and me
have overpowered the guard. Wait until we put him
in your bed. Then we&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad went back to his comrade, and together
they carried the soldier, still unconscious because of
having been choked so severely, into the chamber. The
lieutenant helped them bind the Britisher&rsquo;s hands and
feet, and to muffle his mouth so that he could not
cry out. Then all three left the room, fastening the
door behind them. Down the hall, into the little room
at its rear, and out of the window upon the roof of
the lean-to they went cautiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>At this moment they heard footsteps not far away,
and laid down on the slanting roof. The intruder
evidently crawled into the shed, and, believing he
had gone there for the night, the fugitives slipped
down to the lower edge of the building, when, swinging
themselves to the ground, they made off through
the darkness.</p>
<p>The young scouts were at the mouth of the ravine
when the cry of fire startled them. Looking back
they saw that the lean-to they had just left was in
flames.</p>
<p>During a moment they silently gazed at the burning
building, and then Dan said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole barracks will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that guard may get out,&rdquo; Late added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow we heard crawling into the shed set
fire to it, and I&rsquo;ll tell you who he was,&rdquo; Philip said
solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Daggett,&rdquo; the lieutenant replied, and then
told of the old man&rsquo;s visit and his wish that he
might be burned at the stake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw him prowlin&rsquo; &rsquo;round the lean-to in the
afternoon,&rdquo; Dan explained, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what he was
plannin&rsquo; for. You&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head, Ira&mdash;I
mean Phil&mdash;this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rescued lad laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more &lsquo;Ira,&rsquo; please. It is &lsquo;Phil&rsquo; for you
always. I shall never forget this night&rsquo;s work of
yours, nor will my father and mother,&rdquo; and his voice
grew tremulous as he pronounced the last word.</p>
<p>Then they continued the flight. Possibly the glare
of the fire through the trees chained the attention of
the guards. At least, they gave no special heed to
what was going on in the ravine below them, and
the fugitives passed through it unchallenged. Once
outside it was only necessary to walk rapidly for an
hour, and they had arrived at the Continental camp.</p>
<p>General Schuyler met his son as one come from
the dead, while Joe&rsquo;s delight knew no bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I could have been thar to help in the
rescue,&rdquo; he said over and over again.</p>
<p>Even General Gates, when introduced to the young
lieutenant, congratulated him on his escape, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not understand that the young Tory was
held to secure your safety. Had I known it, he would
not have been allowed to go free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Early next day it became evident that General
Burgoyne was preparing for some desperate move.
Before night he had advanced his lines within two
miles of the Continentals, and the skirmishing parties
sent out from the entrenchments of the latter reported
that the British forces were resting on their
guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that on the morrow he will attempt to
force his way to Albany,&rdquo; General Schuyler said to
General Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you really think so,&rdquo; the officer replied
indifferently, &ldquo;you may notify my subordinates to
stand ready to stop him,&rdquo; and at an early hour he
sought his bed.</p>
<p>Not another officer closed his eyes that night, and
when the memorable nineteenth day of September
dawned it found the rival hosts confronting each
other.</p>
<p>The main body of the Continentals was on the right
under General Lincoln; the left under Poor; the
center was mainly made up of Learned&rsquo;s brigade.
Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen and Dearborn&rsquo;s infantry stood
under Arnold, who had returned from Fort Stanwix,
on the heights, nearly a mile from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock General Burgoyne advanced his
army in three columns; the left consisting of artillery
under General Phillips, and Hessians under General
Riedesel; the center and right were commanded by
Burgoyne himself, but covered by General Fraser and
Colonel Breyman. The Canadians and Indians were
sent forward to occupy the Continentals in front.</p>
<p>No order came from General Gates for his forces
to advance, and Colonel Arnold, growing desperate,
rode off to the commander&rsquo;s tent urging him to allow
the troops to engage the enemy, until he finally gave
orders for the Indians to be driven back.</p>
<p>Taking this as permission for a general charge,
the Continentals rushed like a mountain torrent upon
the foe. Arnold, with Morgan&rsquo;s assistance, held
Fraser while he was endeavoring to reach the American
rear. Here the fighting became desperate, but
the patriots, encountering the British under Burgoyne,
and played on by Phillips&rsquo;s guns, were, at
three o&rsquo;clock, forced back into line. For four or five
hours Colonel Arnold had maintained the fight with
the choicest English regiments. A lull now occurred
during which both armies drew breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been tough work, lieutenant,&rdquo; Dan Cushing
said to Philip Schuyler, as he wiped the sweat from
his brow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the lad replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; our comrades are all
right. When the fightin&rsquo; ceased they went down into
the ravine for a drink of water. They&rsquo;ll be back
&rsquo;fore the lull is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will have to hurry then, for the red-coats
are coming again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here are the boys,&rdquo; was the laughing reply
as the lads arrived.</p>
<p>The Continentals kept within their camp until
their foes were close upon them, then, springing out,
drove them back to the position they had occupied
earlier in the day.</p>
<p>It was, however, not an easy task, and night came
by the time it was accomplished, putting an end to
the conflict. The Continentals withdrew to their entrenchments;
the British lay on the battlefield. Both
parties claimed the victory; but the British had failed
to force their way to Albany, while the Americans
held their ground. It was, therefore, a drawn battle,
in which the losses of the Yankees were less than
three hundred, while those of the king&rsquo;s troops were
more than five hundred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THE CHANCE MEETING.</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning the British retreated to
their old camping ground, and thus each army occupied
precisely the same position it did prior to the
battle, but with the difference that one was disheartened,
and the other was encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear we have Burgoyne in our power,&rdquo;
Colonel Arnold said to a group of fellow officers, as
he watched the movements of the red-coats.</p>
<p>For a brief time there was no response, and then
Colonel Morgan replied in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be, if Schuyler was our commander.
When I remember that General Gates did not appear
on the field at any time yesterday, it makes my blood
boil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears as if some one else is expected to do
the work, while he reaps the reward,&rdquo; another said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t reap the reward of my labors long,
if he don&rsquo;t get a move on,&rdquo; Colonel Arnold retorted
with a frown. &ldquo;I shall resign my commission rather
than serve under such an officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by the appearance
of General Schuyler, without uniform, however, suggestive
of the fact that he was there without rank or
command. He greeted each member of the group
with a hearty shake of the hand, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of you dare beard the lion in his den?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Colonel Arnold replied promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we all join,&rdquo; the general continued, &ldquo;it
seems to me a wise move. If we are agreed, Colonel
Arnold as our spokesman may suggest the plan to
our commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers looked meaningly at each other, and
some shook their heads as if to say, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand
how you can remain here and do all you can
to bring about a victory, when the entire credit of it
will go to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the ex-commander observed the looks and head-shakes,
he gave no heed, but added:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you all know, the enemy is in a condition
which grows worse every day. Counting his sick
and wounded, there are nearly a thousand in the
hospital; many are deserting the ranks; provisions
are becoming exhausted; a few miles in their rear
is an impassable wilderness, and we proved yesterday
that he cannot advance. Let us then send troops
in sufficient number to prevent foraging on the west,
and to cut off connection with his base of supplies
on the east. Then, in a few days, he must either
fight or surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eye doesn&rsquo;t need be more than half open
to see that,&rdquo; Colonel Morgan replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the general need not endanger his own
head by issuing such an order, I may be able to secure
the permission,&rdquo; Colonel Arnold said in a tone of
contempt, and he walked rapidly toward the headquarters
of the commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>How he presented the matter is not known; but
an hour or two later it was rumored about the encampment
that he had been removed from command
of his regiment, for attempting to coerce a superior
officer. When this rumor crystallized into fact, the
entire army was threatened with insubordination.
Only the most strenuous efforts of the division and
brigade commanders, ably assisted by Schuyler, their
former commander-in-chief, prevented open rebellion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; Lieutenant Schuyler said to
his three scouts a little later in the day. &ldquo;To have
our army demoralized in the face of the enemy, is a
good deal like throwing the victory away after it
is in our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, thanks to the efforts of the other officers,
the worst seems to be over,&rdquo; Late replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present, yes,&rdquo; Philip admitted; &ldquo;but
the lightest breeze may fan into a flame the smoldering
fire, and who can tell what General Gates will do
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Lincoln an&rsquo; General Poor have gone to
his quarters for a consultation,&rdquo; Dan announced.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; something may come from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I,&rdquo; Joe added.</p>
<p>Their hopes were gratified. An order was issued
before nightfall for skirmishing parties to be sent
out on all sides of the enemy. Within the hour the
work was begun, and from that time the British
were so hemmed in that it was nearly impossible for
any one to enter or leave their lines without falling
into the hands of the patriots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>One day Lieutenant Schuyler, at the head of a
squad of men which included Dan Cushing, Latham
Wentworth, and Joe Fisher, was scouring the woods
to the westward of the English encampment. He soon
found that his chief work was not to capture soldiers
seeking to enter the camp, but those who were leaving
it. Before noon so many deserters had fallen into
his hands that it required more than half his force
to guard the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the other skirmishers are picking up as many
fugitives as we,&rdquo; the lieutenant said when the latest
captures had been sent within the American lines,
&ldquo;Burgoyne&rsquo;s whole army will be in our hands before
the month is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come some more,&rdquo; Dan, who was on the
right of the squad, said in a low tone. Then, suddenly,
he ran to the side of his leader. &ldquo;There are
a half dozen Tories,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;an&rsquo;, will you believe
it, one is old David Daggett, while another, I
reckon, is his grandson, Ira Le Geyt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lieutenant followed Dan to the other
end of the line, where he could better see the approaching
men. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said a moment later.
&ldquo;David and Ira are both there, and it is well worth
our tramp out here to capture them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He divided his followers into two parties, directing
one to creep cautiously through the forest to the rear
of the royalists, while the other, with himself at its
head, moved back to a place where the thicket offered
a place of concealment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Unaware of the ambush, the Tories advanced, discussing
loudly the reasons which led them to return
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I found that the regular troops were put
on short rations to furnish the rest of us with something
to eat, I thought I&rsquo;d better go home,&rdquo; one man
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed it was time Ira and I went up to the
farm to get food for the others,&rdquo; David Daggett
added. &ldquo;I tell the boy we&rsquo;ve got enough there to
feed a hundred men for a week, and that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you get it down here?&rdquo; another asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira&rsquo;s long head has found a way,&rdquo; the grandfather
explained. &ldquo;If you fellows want to join us
in the venture, come on. All of us, working together,
ought to bring stores enough to supply a regiment for
quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the general will see we are given good
prices for all we take in,&rdquo; a third man remarked.</p>
<p>Then David Daggett grew furious. Whirling
around he shook his fist in the face of the speaker,
crying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curses on your mean, stingy soul, John Tarbox!
The man who at such a time as this is not ready to
give up all he has for the king, ought to be kicked
into the rebel camp, and I&rsquo;d like to be the one to do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the men would have come to blows is uncertain,
for at that moment, the young lieutenant
sprang out from the thicket and seized Master
Daggett by the shoulders. At the same instant Late
and Joe clutched Ira Le Geyt, while the remainder
of the squad gave their attention to the other Tories.
A brief struggle ensued, but when the second party
of Continentals closed in upon the royalists, they
yielded to the inevitable by surrendering.</p>
<p>Owing to the surprise and excitement incident to
the moment, David Daggett did not at first recognize
the leader of the skirmishers. When he did, however,
he gave way to the harshest epithets and the bitterest
invectives he could think of, ending by crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young devil, that is what I think of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion of me is so much better than mine
of you, that it is unnecessary for me to say a single
word,&rdquo; the young officer replied calmly, ordering his
men to fall in with their prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; Ira Le
Geyt demanded. &ldquo;Since you can no longer personate
me at General Burgoyne&rsquo;s headquarters, I should be
allowed to go home, where my father, wounded by
you or some of your men, lies dangerously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must prevent that long head of yours from
devising some means of getting stores into the British
camp,&rdquo; Joe replied. &ldquo;You ought to be grateful to us
for saving you from so strenuous a task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Tory frowned, and relapsed into silence.
But not so with the older one. His wrath had now
given place to curiosity, and he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you escape from that building after I
set it on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I got out before,&rdquo; Philip answered with
a smile. Then, to learn whether the soldier he and
his comrades had bound and left in his bed was yet
alive, he asked, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the guard tell you how I
got away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; the old man replied
angrily. &ldquo;Some men who went up there found him
bound and gagged, so brought him down. But when
it was possible for him to talk, he had nothing to tell.
Never knew who tied him, or when it happened. He
was certain, though, that the door was fastened on
the outside, and it puzzled him to know how you got
at him, unless some one lent a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had good friends,&rdquo; Philip replied, glancing
with a smile at Dan and Late, who were behind
him.</p>
<p>The old prisoner failed to see the glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say the devil helps his own,&rdquo; he retorted,
&ldquo;and he must have been the one who helped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Philip looked over his shoulder at his friends,
and laughed outright, while Joe, who was near enough
to hear what old David had said, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather rough on you lads, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice the old Tory turned and,
seeing both Late and Joe, cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here, too, you young devils? It seems to be
a good day for the breed.&rdquo; Then he sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Devils on ahead!</p>
<p class="t0">Devils in the rear!</p>
<p class="t0">If the devils were all dead,</p>
<p class="t0">You rebels wouldn&rsquo;t be here!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Some of the soldiers laughed, others showed signs
of anger, and the lieutenant said warningly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you keep that up long, Uncle David, my men
will serve you as your friends threatened to do at
the old hut.&rdquo; The song came to a sudden close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>A half-hour later the prisoners were in the Continental
camp, confined with an hundred others who
had been brought in that day. Then Philip and his
friends went to the mess-room for supper. While
they were eating an orderly came in, and, touching the
lieutenant on the shoulder, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Gates wishes to see you at seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go immediately,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>On entering the quarters of the commander-in-chief
he was surprised to find his father there. General
Gates&rsquo;s first words, however, explained why the
former commander was with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Schuyler,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I sent for your
father to consult with him about a matter which gives
me considerable anxiety. Ever since I learned that
the courier, Preston, whom I ignorantly set at liberty,
had papers for General Clinton in New York, I have
been fearful lest that officer should send a force up
the river to the aid of General Burgoyne, and attack
us in the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;I regard your father as altogether too sanguine
when he declares it impossible for Clinton to force
his way up the river. It may be so, I hope it is so;
but that I may be certain there is no danger of such
a happening, I have decided to send a trustworthy
messenger down the Hudson to learn the exact condition
of affairs there. Your father suggested yourself
as one who could perform the task to my satisfaction.
In my judgment you are rather young for
such a trust; but there is some truth in your father&rsquo;s
declaration that, &lsquo;boys can sometimes pass unnoticed
where older messengers would excite suspicion.&rsquo;
Therefore I have decided to try you. Take as many
friends as you think advisable; tell my quartermaster
to furnish you with horses and whatever else may be
needed, and get away to-night if possible. Go only
far enough to make certain we are safe from a rear
attack for at least two weeks, and then return with
your report. Within that time we hope to overcome
the enemy in front of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be at Albany before daylight,&rdquo; the lad
said, and with a bow to the commander and a whispered
&ldquo;good-by&rdquo; to his father, he left the room, but
General Schuyler followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stop at our home, Phil?&rdquo; the father
said when they were out of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then assure your mother that my removal from
command was due to no fault of mine; that I hold
enmity toward no one, and shall remain here to do my
full duty to our country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell her that, and also give her proof that
you were removed through the scheming of the
enemy,&rdquo; the boy answered, and then, as they walked
along, he told his father that of which Alexander
Turnbull, the spy, had boasted.</p>
<p>General Schuyler listened with the deepest interest,
and when Philip had concluded, exclaimed reverently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank the good Lord that He permitted you to
overhear those statements, my son. I did not dream
that the Tories of this region were back of the movement
to oust me. No greater compliment could have
been paid, and I can now bear the seeming disgrace
with more fortitude. In time the world will know
the truth, of that I am confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; the younger officer replied, laying his
hand in his father&rsquo;s &ldquo;and I can only hope to imitate
the unselfish devotion to the Cause which you, sir,
are showing in an experience when many men would
falter in, if not wholly abandon, their efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before nine o&rsquo;clock Philip, accompanied by his
three friends, all well mounted and well armed, rode
rapidly toward Albany. Two hours before sunrise
they had arrived at the town, and at one of the finest
estates on its outskirts drew rein. Phil, dismounting,
pounded heavily on the lodge gate with the stock of
his rifle. Soon a voice cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Bill, and let us in,&rdquo; the young officer replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! &rsquo;Tis you, Master Phil,&rdquo; came the reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bolts were shot back, the gate was thrown
open, and the four lads entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right to the barn with you, Bill, and
turn in there for a few hours,&rdquo; the leader of the little
party said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to disturb mother until her
usual hour for rising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, Master Phil,&rdquo; the old servant replied,
and in a few minutes he had taken their horses, while
the weary riders, throwing some blankets on the soft
hay, stretched themselves upon them and went to
sleep. They were aroused by a girlish voice calling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil! Brother Phil, where are you? Bill said
you had come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, Susan,&rdquo; Philip answered, and, rising,
he went to the door of the barn where he met his
sister, who was a few years younger than himself.
After greeting her affectionately, he said: &ldquo;I have
three lads with me. Will you tell mother? Then
we&rsquo;ll join you at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me meet your friends first,&rdquo; she said, waiting
for them to come forward. After they were presented,
she remarked pleasantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of you all through my father&rsquo;s letters,
and you will find a warm welcome here.&rdquo; Then she
ran on ahead to announce their coming.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were in the presence of Mistress
Schuyler, who received her son as only a fond
mother can, and extended to the other lads a most
cordial greeting. A hearty meal was served a little
later, and then the daughter entertained the other
boys while Phil and his mother had a half-hour together,
during which he delivered his father&rsquo;s message.
With a heroism that matched her husband&rsquo;s
she sent back the reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we may be wronged, our best motives
misunderstood, our most earnest efforts unappreciated,
but nothing can really disgrace us so long as we are
true to our duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Changing horses at the stables, the four scouts continued
their journey. Down the west bank of the
river they hastened, stopping occasionally at the
houses of well-known patriots, but hearing nothing of
any reinforcements for Burgoyne. Two days later
they were at West Point, closeted with its commander.
When they had made known the purpose of their long
journey, he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;Return to your commander-in-chief with the assurance
that he has nothing to fear from any force
General Clinton can send up the Hudson. He has
attempted that move already, and after capturing
Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery, was compelled
to turn back. Burgoyne has no hope of succor from
this quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their mission accomplished, the young messengers,
after a night&rsquo;s rest, set out on their return. Ten
miles above the fort they halted in a beautiful spot
to allow their panting horses a breathing-time. The
heavy trees in their autumn foliage screened the
travelers from any one on the river, unless very near
at hand, therefore it happened that a canoe, sweeping
around the bend a little below, was seen by them before
its single occupant became aware of their whereabouts.</p>
<p>While Late and Joe led the horses back farther
among the foliage lest they attract attention, the other
two scouts concealed themselves behind a large rock
to watch the approaching voyager. At length Dan
Cushing&rsquo;s keen eyes recognized him, and he whispered
in greatest excitement:</p>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;It is the courier, George Preston!&rdquo;</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE BITTER AND THE SWEET.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the courier sure enough,&rdquo; Philip said,
&ldquo;and he is probably going to Burgoyne&rsquo;s camp with
a message from General Clinton. If we could capture
him, we might find out what Sir Henry proposes
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t unless we had better luck than when
we caught him the time before,&rdquo; Dan replied grimly.</p>
<p>The lieutenant laughed. &ldquo;You are right; but
we&rsquo;ll hope for better luck this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you goin&rsquo; to get him?&rdquo; Dan asked a
moment later. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t look as if he was comin&rsquo;
ashore right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not for several hours,&rdquo; Philip replied.
&ldquo;I suspect he passed the night at the house of Beverly
Robinson, near West Point, for he had that
Tory&rsquo;s name on his list. Likely he is intending to
take his dinner with Isaac Neale, another Tory living
five or six miles above us. We&rsquo;ll follow and see;
if I&rsquo;m correct, we&rsquo;ll plan to seize him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Preston was now opposite the lads, and paddled
swiftly by, unconscious of his danger. They
waited until he had disappeared around a bend in the
river, and then went in search of their companions.
Then it was they arranged for Late and Joe to stay
well in the rear with the horses, while they kept the
courier in sight.</p>
<p>Now and then a curve in the shore-line forced them
to mount their horses in order to keep pace with the
voyager; but when they were come within a half-mile
of Isaac Neale&rsquo;s house, the steeds were hidden
in the woods while all four scouts went up the trail
on foot.</p>
<p>Snugly hidden behind one of the Tory&rsquo;s barns, they
watched Master Preston as he came ashore and went
up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lacks an hour of noon,&rdquo; Philip said, looking
at his watch, &ldquo;and the men are doubtless at their
work. It is a good time to capture the courier, and
we&rsquo;ll set about it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed intently at the house. It was a two-story
building, standing bare and alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there were two more of us,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;but we must do the best we can. Joe is to take a
station where he can watch the south and east sides.
Late is to stand guard over the north and west ends.
Dan and I will enter the house. Now!&rdquo; and he led
the way at full speed.</p>
<p>By the time Philip and his comrade were at the
door, the other lads were at their stations. The lieutenant
and Dan entered without ceremony, to find
the courier in the act of ascending the stairs. Recognizing
them instantly, he ran swiftly, the scouts at
his heels, into the nearest chamber, the door of which
he quickly closed and fastened.</p>
<p>Philip and Dan threw themselves upon the barrier,
forcing an entrance just in time to see Master Preston
go out of the window. Dan ran back, down the stairs
and out of the main door; but Phil followed the fugitive,
intending to leap after him. But that act was
unnecessary, for Master Preston was already in the
clutches of Late and Joe.</p>
<p>Philip noted that the man had been injured by the
jump, and had lost not only his hat, but the hair
from his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wore a wig!&rdquo; Philip cried in surprise.
&ldquo;There is where he hid his letters,&rdquo; and he hastened
downstairs to where the prisoner lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have me this time,&rdquo; the courier exclaimed
as he caught sight of Phil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your papers,&rdquo; the latter replied, picking up
the wig to find a pocket on the inside where was a
small, thin, sealed package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I meant,&rdquo; Master Preston said with
a groan. &ldquo;Now you know where I concealed the messages
when you captured me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you injured?&rdquo; the young officer asked,
stooping beside his captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He broke his leg when he jumped,&rdquo; Late answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I struck the ground, you mean,&rdquo; the courier
added with a faint attempt at a smile. &ldquo;But for
that I should have escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Joe interrupted, &ldquo;for I had my rifle
trained on you, an&rsquo; in another minute would have
fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we carry him into the house?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>The women of the family had already gathered
near, some crying hysterically, others looking on
with pale and frightened faces. The eldest,
Mistress Neale as her words proved, said somewhat
timidly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, take him into the house, good sirs, and I&rsquo;ll
send one of the girls for her father, who is in the
field. He will know just what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much as I regret it,&rdquo; the leader of the squad
replied gently, &ldquo;I am forced to ask you to delay
sending for Master Neale.&rdquo; Then to Joe, he said,
&ldquo;Bring up the horses,&rdquo; and to Late, &ldquo;Keep guard
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip and Dan lifted the injured courier, carrying
him up to the chamber, where he was laid on the
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, Master Preston, that you will not be
overlong in recovering,&rdquo; he said as he turned to leave
the unfortunate fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few weeks here will pass more pleasantly than
months, perhaps, in the dungeon of a fort,&rdquo; Preston
replied. &ldquo;You are kind to leave me with my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before gaining the outer door, the boys heard him
say to Mistress Neale, who was striving to relieve
his suffering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the smartest Yankee I have fallen in
with since I came to this country. Burgoyne will be
whipped, and it is largely due to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of General Schuyler,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>The words could be heard in the yard, where the
daughters of Mistress Neale were still waiting. The
eldest, a fair girl of sixteen or seventeen years, turned
and gazed at the young officer, who was mounting
his horse, with a look of admiration, and as he rode
away said to her younger sister:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he is a rebel, he is handsomer
than any British officer I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, who was nearer her than either of his comrades,
heard the confession, and it was a long time
before he ceased teasing his chief about the &ldquo;Tory
sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>Four or five miles up the trail Philip opened the
letter he had taken from the wig of the courier. It
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;New York, October, 1777.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To General John Burgoyne,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commanding His Majesty&rsquo;s Army in Northern New York,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Honored Sir</span>:&mdash;Your message, and also that of
Lord Germain, reached me two weeks since by the
hand of Master George Preston. He had been apprehended
and held by the rebels for months, yet
succeeded in keeping and at length delivering to me
the messages entrusted to his care, an unusual exploit,
for which he deserves the highest commendation.
On receipt of them I immediately undertook to comply
with your request and with the order of the war
secretary, but, after reaching and capturing the forts
known as Clinton and Montgomery a few miles up
the river, I was compelled to abandon the enterprise.
I regret greatly, therefore, to inform you there is no
hope of my forcing the passage of the Hudson this
season. I would suggest that you entrench yourself
in some suitable place where you can maintain a defense
during the winter, and doubtless in the spring
I shall be able to come to your aid.</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;I remain your obedient servant,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Henry Clinton</span>,</span></p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Commanding His Majesty&rsquo;s Army in Southern New York.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Handing the missive to his companions in turn,
Philip said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have done no great harm if we had not
captured Preston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as though it would have discouraged
Burgoyne a little more,&rdquo; Dan added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he is blue enough now,&rdquo; Late suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is if matters have worked after the style they
were goin&rsquo; when we came away,&rdquo; Joe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, this letter confirms our report, and is from
a source that cannot be doubted,&rdquo; Philip said cheerily.
&ldquo;General Gates need no longer fear a foe in
his rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; will have no excuse for not advancing,&rdquo; Dan
Cushing declared.</p>
<p>The lads finished their journey without other incident,
and on the evening of October sixth arrived
at Bemis Heights. In a few minutes later the commander-in-chief
had heard their report and received
the letter from Sir Henry Clinton. The latter interested
him greatly, and he insisted on hearing a
full account of how it came into his scout&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father was right, lieutenant,&rdquo; he said graciously
when the story had been told. &ldquo;I could not
have sent one better fitted for the mission than yourself.
With no enemy to attack us in our rear, we can
give our undivided attention to those in front. I will
soon issue an order for an attack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>But on the following morning such a step was
unnecessary. At an early hour, prompted by a threatened
famine, General Burgoyne directed that a foraging
force, numbering fifteen hundred, break through
the western line of skirmishers and scour the surrounding
country in search of food. This movement
was immediately detected by the Continentals, and,
mistaking it for the beginning of a general attack
on the part of the red-coats, they prepared for
battle.</p>
<p>Leaving the breastworks they dashed down the hill
upon the enemy&rsquo;s front. It was an attack which the
British could not withstand, and they gave way before
it. Rallying, however, a little later, they drove
the assailants back.</p>
<p>To and fro they struggled, sometimes the British,
sometimes the patriots having the best of the contest.
So evenly balanced were the contending forces that
the same cannon changed hands five times. Finally
the patriots succeeded in holding the piece, and their
colonel leaping upon it cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now dedicate this to the American cause.&rdquo;
Then he ordered it wheeled around, and, having been
loaded with British ammunition, it was discharged
again and again into the ranks of its former owners,
becoming an important factor in driving them from
the field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>At the same time an extraordinary flank movement
was being executed. General Fraser, with the finest
corps of the English army, fell upon the left of the
Continentals. Colonel Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen drove the
attacking party back, and they in their turn charged
impetuously upon the British right. During the entire
day there was no hotter fighting than that which
centered at this point.</p>
<p>Upon the heights stood an interested spectator. It
was Colonel Arnold, who, though deprived of his
command, had not yet left the encampment. As he
watched the progress of the battle he could no longer
restrain himself. Mounting his horse, he rode at
breakneck speed toward the left field. General Gates
immediately ordered one of his staff officers to follow
and recall the daring officer. But the aide could not
overtake him. Into the thickest of the fight, and on
to the head of his regiment, the impetuous colonel rode.
His men recognized and received him with cheers;
then, rallying, they followed him in a charge before
which the red-coats wavered like grain before a tempest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Colonel Morgan had already discovered that General
Fraser was the inspiration of the British forces,
and, selecting some of his best marksmen, he directed
them to make the intrepid commander their special
target. Soon Fraser&rsquo;s horse was shot under him; but
he refused to retire from the field. Mounting a fresh
steed he again placed himself at the head of his men,
and a few moments later fell, mortally wounded.</p>
<p>This turned the tide of the battle. Though General
Burgoyne in person tried to rally his men, his efforts
were vain. Driven from their entrenchments by
Arnold&rsquo;s troops, they became demoralized and, after
firing a single volley, turned and fled.</p>
<p>In this last charge a bullet shattered Colonel
Arnold&rsquo;s thigh, and he fell from his horse just as
Major Armstrong, who had been sent to recall him
from the field, reached his side. He obeyed the order;
but four men carried him, and he left behind a
shattered foe, and a victorious army.</p>
<p>Night fell, and the patriots remained in possession
of the field. The British fled, intending to cross the
Hudson and return to Fort Edward. Their loss was
about seven hundred, while that of the Americans
was but one hundred and fifty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>General Gates, who had remained in the camp all
day, then made a move which is to his credit. Discovering,
notwithstanding the heavy fog which had
set in, the attempt of Burgoyne to recross the river,
he sent out a force to prevent his escape. All the
next day there was heavy skirmishing, and then the
harassed Britisher, leaving his baggage and wounded,
set out on a night march for Saratoga. On the ninth
he encamped on the heights north of the Fishkill.
The patriots pursued, and on the tenth arrived at the
heights between Saratoga church and the river.</p>
<p>Then the fleeing general lost hope. His position
was exposed to attack on all sides; the roads to the
north were impassable, and the woods swarming with
patriots. He had bread sufficient only for three days,
and no water. Surrender seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth he called together his officers for
council. While they were deliberating grape-shot
from the guns of the pursuers swept across the table
around which they were seated. Possibly it hastened
their decision. It was agreed to treat with the American
commander for honorable surrender.</p>
<p>It required three days for the two commanders to
agree upon terms, but on the sixteenth they were
finally arranged, and on the seventeenth articles were
signed permitting the British to march out with the
honors of war, while on their part they surrendered
artillery, arms, and ammunition, agreeing not to
re-enter the king&rsquo;s service during the war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>General Burgoyne on that afternoon, in the presence
of the two armies, handed his sword to General
Gates, who promptly returned it. Then the entire
British army, numbering nearly six thousand, filed
off toward Boston, from which port they were to embark
for England.</p>
<p>The four young scouts watched the long line of
prisoners as they filed away, and Dan asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose the king will say when he
sees them come marchin&rsquo; home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the bottom has fallen out of his plans,&rdquo;
Philip replied with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t be so with our men,&rdquo; Late added. &ldquo;The
news will put new fight in &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll lick every
red-coat that comes their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the rest of the world will think we mean
business,&rdquo; Joe added gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident it will secure for us the help of
France, which means that we shall gain what we are
fighting for&mdash;our national independence,&rdquo; a voice behind
them said.</p>
<p>Turning, the boys saw General Schuyler, who
added: &ldquo;In time to come, I believe, it will generally
be acknowledged that this battle of Saratoga was one
of the decisive battles of the world, and you, my lads,
may be proud because in it you have borne an honorable
and important part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; they all shouted, filled with enthusiasm
at the thought.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">Two weeks later General Schuyler and his son stood
in the presence of General Washington. During an
hour they had been with him discussing the details
of the northern campaign, and now had arisen to depart.
Taking the father by the hand the brave commander-in-chief
of the American forces said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never forget, sir, that at no time have I lost confidence
in you, and I shall not rest until I have secured
your full vindication at the hands of Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to the son he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The part you have played in this notable victory
has proved, my lad, that you are the worthy son of a
worthy sire. In my report to the Congressional committee
I shall recommend that you be given a captain&rsquo;s
commission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what for my three comrades?&rdquo; the young
scout asked eagerly. &ldquo;I assure you they never once
failed me, and two of them risked their lives to save
me from death. The other would have been with
them in that undertaking had not his duty called him
elsewhere. If need be, give me nothing, but bestow
on them some evidence that you appreciate their faithful
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave it for their captain to make them warrant
officers in his own command,&rdquo; was the smiling reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall have, then, the highest places I can
give them,&rdquo; Phil said stoutly, &ldquo;and I can safely
promise that you will hear good tidings from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A promise which was made good under General
Lincoln when he took command of the army in the
south.</p>
